00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
Unknown: This today is a
background on open licenses

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,450
specifically for with
information that might be

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,720
helpful for your open life
science projects. Disclaimer

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,500
number one, I'm not a lawyer.
You'll hear that again during

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,510
the talk. So, I'm going to keep
going if everything's okay,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,240
audio video. Okay, so I'm
Christine Rogers, I see a few

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,610
people who know me already on
this call. So shout out to my

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,650
Montreal, people like Kendra and
Sam gays crew. I'm part of that

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,020
open science ecosystem based in
Montreal. Personally, I'm at

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,110
McGill University at the
Montreal Neurological Institute,

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,030
which is the largest academic
Open Science Research Institute

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,210
going. And, specifically, I'm a
Data Manager, research research

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,590
project officer on a number of
open science projects and

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,540
initiatives. Because I work for
the Loris databasing group, we

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,520
make an open source platform,
that's basically data tool

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,870
databasing, data sharing for
neuroscience research. And it's

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,590
also used in a lot of open
science initiatives. So that's

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,450
my context. I have also been a
part of the open lifesigns

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,050
cohort that started in January,
very happy to be

20
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,530
back.

21
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,529
And I focused in that phase on
adoptability metrics and support

22
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:32,579
for open source research
software. I'm also involved in

23
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,699
some of Google's open source
programs in terms of mentoring

24
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:39,659
for Google Summer of Code, and
Google season docs this fall,

25
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,359
and if anyone wants to connect
with me, you can reach me on

26
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,499
Twitter, my handle is at the
bottom of the slide, and I will

27
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:50,579
take it from there. So today
we're talking about licensing.

28
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,439
The purpose of the presentation,
for the context of the open Life

29
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,079
Science program is that licenses
are going to allow you and

30
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,439
anyone to use, remix and share
what you're doing on your

31
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,579
project. The outcome of today
and under the exercises you're

32
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:11,459
going through today is that your
project is going to be openly

33
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,569
licensed for use for re mixing
and for sharing. Today we're

34
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,779
doing a short presentation,
followed by discussion with some

35
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:22,379
practical steps to help you work
towards adding an open license

36
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,759
to your work. The steps are
really simple, the thinking

37
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,149
behind it is worth taking a
moment to go over. So that's the

38
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:34,919
plan for today. Am I still good
on the audio visual front? Okay,

39
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,479
great. I just have to figure out
what to click.

40
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,160
About. There you go. Yeah. Okay.

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,150
So how does this fit into the
open leadership framework? Let's

42
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,130
start there. The context of the
open leadership framework is

43
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,940
that open leaders will design
and build projects that empower

44
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,410
others to collaborate within
inclusive communities. And with

45
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,320
licensing, when you think of
licensing you don't really think

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,730
of empowering, you think of
restricting, I think is terms of

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,520
everyone's experience with user
licenses would be a really

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,510
familiar example. For example, a
lot of people know MATLAB in

49
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,510
terms of the context that it's
available free for use for

50
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,840
academia. But if you're trying
to use the context of company,

51
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,970
or privately, suddenly, the
license costs a lot of money. So

52
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,900
user licenses are one
perspective, we're going to flip

53
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,440
the script today, because from
your point of view, as a creator

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,010
of a project, you're looking to
add a license to your project,

55
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,730
that's going to tell others,
what they're free to do with

56
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,770
your work, how they can share
it, reproduce it, adapt it, and

57
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,170
what their rights and
obligations are in that respect.

58
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,000
And that also gives you as the
creator the protection of having

59
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,800
those clearly in place, having
that framework, but at the same

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,580
time, being able to share what
you've produced really openly

61
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,710
once that is in place. So that's
how licenses can be a powerful

62
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:13,410
tool for sharing. And that's how
they also fit into the grid for

63
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,220
the open leadership framework.
under the category of build for

64
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,880
sharing, licensing is something
that really enables you to share

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,580
your work as you build out your
project. There's a few key

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,090
aspects to licensing. I'm not an
expert. I'm not a lawyer, I'm

67
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,050
not your lawyer. But we're going
to continue on this basis with a

68
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,660
bit of background for truly open
licenses, I think they all have

69
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,160
the common elements about use
modification and sharing of

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,700
software. So use is just who can
use the work and for what

71
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,510
purpose, whether it's commercial
or research, only modification

72
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,020
can that work be modified, who
can modify it for what purpose

73
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,020
and then sharing so if If you
make a modification to work, can

74
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,370
you share what you produce with
other people? And how? And can

75
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,120
you redistribute the original
also, there's a definition of

76
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,170
open source down below. And I'm
going to avoid the debate on

77
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,110
what open source isn't is not
today and skip ahead to what you

78
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,030
guys need to know about
licensing. So under those three

79
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,170
common elements of truly open
licensing, the first part where

80
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,320
it's important to pay attention
to how this impacts you is

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,550
attribution. So most open
licenses will require others to

82
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,630
credit the authors or copyright
holders of the work. That's a

83
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,420
pretty common thing that a lot
of people are used to examples

84
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,750
are with the Creative Commons bi
license, and almost all the

85
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,000
other licenses, you need to
attribute the work when you use

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,020
it. To the original authors.
This is really common, if he's a

87
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,320
photo, for example, you're going
to want to credit the source.

88
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,990
There's also a type of license
that says there's no attribution

89
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,140
to be made. And that's a cc zero
license, which says it's

90
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,960
something is effectively in the
public domain and is actually no

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,580
copyright holder. So moving on
from attribution. The next

92
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,180
important thing is distribution.
So when you when you're

93
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,200
distributing something to the
original or something that you

94
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,370
modified, what are your rights
and obligations. So the two main

95
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,790
types of open licensing aspects
are non copyleft and copyleft.

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,990
Starting with copyleft, this is
a permissive non reciprocal

97
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,670
license. The important point is
that it's an open license that

98
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,340
does not require derivative
works to be shared using the

99
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,700
same license. Examples of the CC
by license MIT BSD and AAPL 2.0

100
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,810
license. On the other hand, you
have copyleft licenses, these

101
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,990
are reciprocal or viral
licenses. And the idea is that

102
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,200
an open license, it's an open
license that requires all

103
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,780
derivative works to be shared
with the same license. So

104
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,730
anything downstream of the
original code or product needs

105
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,900
to be shared using the same
license. So in that sense,

106
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,890
you're restricted to the same
conditions. So examples of that

107
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,150
are the CC by sa license GPL,
v3, which is really common in

108
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,100
the Unix community, and or Linux
Mint, I should say. Then MPL

109
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,010
2.0. So just a bit more context
about these two aspects, what

110
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,440
does it mean to require
derivative works to be shared

111
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,940
with the same license or not?

112
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,300
In my context, we make an open
source tool. And we allow people

113
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,260
afford to freely make their own
adaptations, and then use that

114
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,770
for their own purposes. But the
moment that they want to share

115
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,610
what they've done features,
they've added maybe domain

116
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,940
specific tools or content in
there, the moment they want to

117
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,340
share that with, let's say,
their colleagues in the same

118
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,380
field or someone else. Our
license is a GPL three, which is

119
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,500
a copyleft license, and it's
governs them. So we've

120
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,000
effectively required them to
contribute their modifications

121
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,880
back to the community. And the
idea with that is that anything

122
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:27,060
open needs to stay open. So the
good side is that the community

123
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:33,630
benefits, that's the idea. The
downside to think about with

124
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:39,120
copyleft is that it means that
it might actually be a

125
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,330
deterrent, in some cases, from
letting people use it for

126
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,750
private use, because it can't go
very far without them being

127
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,180
obligated to openly share it. On
the other hand, copyleft also

128
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,480
has the benefit that money for
that statement, non copyleft,

129
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,100
some licenses actually enable
people to take your work and

130
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,310
make their own version. And
technically they could actually

131
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,610
sell that version that they
modify. So that's something to

132
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,840
keep in mind with non copyleft
licenses. There's many things to

133
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,930
look at on both sides. But
that's kind of the context in

134
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:23,220
which these things are
important. So moving on, for in

135
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,250
terms of patent clauses, most
modern open source software

136
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,610
licensing Do you contain a
clause that is designed to

137
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,970
prevent people from using patent
law to take away open source

138
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,720
rights? That's called patent
snapback and that means that the

139
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,470
patent rights sort of by default
revert to the person who

140
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,300
released it. Examples of this
are NPL, AAPL and GPL v3.

141
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,530
Sometimes this isn't applicable
and older licenses like MIT and

142
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,590
BSD, but I don't think that
would be a concern for people

143
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,570
applying licenses here
necessarily.

144
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,550
In terms of how to

145
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,000
apply a license, it's actually
very simple. If you're used

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,660
GitHub, which I think this
program still is as a default

147
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,420
tool, then you GitHub has a
really easy, it's not even a

148
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,390
workflow. It's like a prompt.
When you start a new project to

149
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,780
add a license, you as you can
see from the slide, it's a drop

150
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,500
down that you just select what
kind of license you want to use.

151
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,460
So couldn't be easier to
actually apply it on your file.

152
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,510
And it's typically in a file
called license or licensed dot

153
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,800
txt, often all caps you stick it
in the main directory of your

154
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,270
project, and GitHub will do that
for you. So also, in terms of

155
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,990
how to apply a license, beyond
just putting the file in your

156
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,260
repository, there are specific
instructions, you need to follow

157
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,220
on certain licenses, details are
available at those links, choose

158
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,340
license, comm
creativecommons.org, those links

159
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,920
will appear again on the last
slide. So we'll come back to

160
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,460
these resources. Also good to
know is that you can have

161
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,240
multiple licenses within a
single project, some for content

162
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,390
and some for the actual software
part, just as long as you're

163
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,300
clear about which goes on which
and that's typically done in the

164
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,560
readme of your project. Details
on copyleft, non copyleft,

165
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:21,990
patent snapback older licenses
with no patent clause, versus

166
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,320
attribution and no attribution
is broken down here in this

167
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,600
table. There's, you know, choose
a license comm is a great

168
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,350
resource for choosing licenses
for software for content, people

169
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,280
might gravitate towards the
Creative Commons licensing. And

170
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,760
then I'm gonna put a caveat at
the bottom for data, some people

171
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,170
use csio. I am not going to go
into that today. But I just want

172
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,370
to say like from my research
context, data licensing and data

173
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,480
sharing is very special and very
tricky. There are a lot of

174
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,980
considerations. For some of you
who might be doing a survey for

175
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,460
your project, you might include
one, including presentation

176
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,850
consideration, such as
participant consent, and the

177
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,450
ethics of data sharing, if
you're collecting data, whether

178
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,780
the data your data can use for
commercial purposes, or you just

179
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,680
want to use for research
purposes and what that means. So

180
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,670
licensing data as a whole other
fields, and I'll leave that sort

181
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,360
of out of the scope of today's
talk. If anyone's doing a

182
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,410
hardware project just for fun on
the side hardware licenses are

183
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,500
also another specialty. So those
things are slightly out of the

184
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,420
scope today, but still
definitely relevant domains. So

185
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,460
coming to the end, here are some
links for further reading. There

186
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,290
are some books, there are some
guides. And one thing I would

187
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,560
advise is that when you're
choosing a license, don't go to

188
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,920
the Wikipedia page. Yo, this was
the meme I was gonna make for

189
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,170
you don't go to Wikipedia page,
do actually look around in your

190
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,590
community that you're going to
release your project into that's

191
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,070
the code or the the program or
framework or the data that

192
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,640
you're that you're working
towards, what's the community

193
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,050
that's going to use it and
modify and adapt it and take it

194
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,820
further and what licensing is
the norm or common practice

195
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,960
there. Because you are also
signaling kind of like the

196
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,110
values of your project through
the licensing that you use. And

197
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,380
you want to use as much as
possible a license that people

198
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,160
are comfortable with, and
conforms with the standards that

199
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,660
that that are prevalent in the
community that you're actually

200
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,220
trying to attract and build
with. Okay, and then at the

201
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,210
bottom to the license. Zilla,
open leadership actually has its

202
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,930
own page on licensing. So there
have been a summary there. And

203
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,050
then those links again for
chooser, license calm, which is

204
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,630
kind of like choose your own
adventure, explore licensing,

205
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,870
and creative commons.org are
great resources for getting

206
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,670
started on this licensing
adventure. So I hope that helps

207
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,370
with the covering some content
for licensing. And that's my

208
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:11,970
talk today.
