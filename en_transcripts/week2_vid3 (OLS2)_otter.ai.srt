1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
Unknown: All right, so we are
still in the open by design.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,100
What we want to do is to
discover how to use a roadmap to

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,580
plan our work and find
contribution for our open

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,110
project. And we're going to also
look at few examples, as we saw

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,780
for open canvas. So open leader
design, and now we're gonna move

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,620
to a bit about empowering others
to collaborate within the open

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,680
communities. And when we think
about empowering others, it's a

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,230
lot about knowledge sharing.
Keeping with this framework, we

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,290
are at this part, we're still
designing for participation and

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,440
inclusion, we want to think
about what the project's

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,700
identity is, and what are ways
people interact with my project.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,070
The intention behind this is to
create an a welcoming space,

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,760
make a good impression, so
others know that they are in the

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,700
right place, and you know, that
you're communicating well

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,750
explain how one can get involved
in your project, and let them

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,050
know what's happening next. So
they can decide if this is the

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,570
right project for them to be
involved in. What goes into the

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,420
roadmap, there are three things
that you will be thinking about

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,620
the would go into roadmap. First
is project summary, and you

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,290
actually creating this welcoming
space, telling people how to get

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,860
involved. And what is the
timeline timeline may be

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,280
changing quite a lot, but it is
still a good idea to tell them

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,590
what you are at what would you
be doing next. So this project

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,000
summary in welcoming space would
require would be required. So

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,510
people who are visiting your
project can get oriented with

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,780
where your project has
information, what kind of

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,010
resources do you have, it is
important for them to understand

28
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,630
where they are often in a new
project, the biggest blocker is

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,320
that the newness of that space,
and you want to help them to

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,270
feel familiar with the space
that they are in having the

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,500
project summary as the first
page. So if you all are familiar

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,100
with GitHub, you wouldn't be
calling it as a readme. But if

33
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,820
you are familiar with any other
product, you would always see a

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,210
summary page, which gives an
overview of the project, it

35
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,840
helps to give a clear focus on
when writing the rest of the

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,610
roadmap. Second is how to get
involved This is about your

37
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,510
contributors. It's possible that
some contributors are available

38
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,660
to jump in right away. But they
can do that only if they know

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,410
what is the task in hand. And if
the skills that they have is

40
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,890
actually appropriate for your
project. Some people might not

41
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,580
be available right now, but they
know about your project and want

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,520
to come back. And they should
also know how they can get

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,100
involved when they're coming
back. So you need to have a

44
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,900
documentation that you wish they
would be able to check out. This

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,620
is the start of your roadmap,
the timeline, it organizes tasks

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,550
to complete your project around
milestones. This is, again,

47
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,700
we're going to come back to all
these concepts in the future

48
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,630
calls for these are for you to
think about already. How do you

49
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,900
see your project in the next
weeks or so? How do you see your

50
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,220
project at the end of wellness?
Or how do you see it afterwards.

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,490
So you need to think about
milestone, these are significant

52
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,730
turning points or events that
will move the project forward.

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,780
So this is also allowing you to
assess what the progress of your

54
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,140
project has been. You can have a
status goal, for example, a

55
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,700
feature release or minimum
viable product. You can also be

56
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,540
hosting an event for example,
giving a talk or attending a

57
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,100
hackathon or hosting a community
call. You can have timeframe as

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,650
well, you can define your
milestone in three levels, you

59
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,130
can have a short term, you can
have a medium term and a long

60
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,270
term goal. Therefore, anyone
who's available right now can

61
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,910
get involved in short term
people who want to come back

62
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,370
they would be looking at medium
and long term milestones. Then

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,690
just telling the milestones is
not enough, you are the project

64
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,350
lead and therefore you need to
define what kind of direction

65
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,080
you want to take. And these
direction can be clarified by

66
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,260
listing out the tasks that these
milestone will involve.

67
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,810
You can and these are iterative
process again, right this is

68
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,930
this is not something that we're
expecting you to complete right

69
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,470
away. But this is the process
you want to implement in your

70
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,570
project. So you would want to
list tasks by stating what needs

71
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,260
to be done, what is the success
looks like and the success in

72
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,230
terms of what would complete the
project milestone one single

73
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,630
milestone, you don't need to
think about the full project at

74
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,320
the moment. You also want to
share pointers to get started

75
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,860
and these pointers could be
skill building resources, or it

76
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,100
could be about contribution
guideline. It could be anything

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,090
that can help you contributor to
feel that they are in a position

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,290
to get involved. And you also
need to state why this task is

79
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,430
important and reinforce your
vision. And this is very useful

80
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,030
because these contributors are
there to support your project

81
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,690
not work for you. So you don't
need to look at them as someone

82
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,170
who will complete a task, but
they you want to involve them in

83
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,930
building a project and make them
feel as part of your journey. So

84
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,320
how to share the roadmap, we you
can have a file called

85
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,060
roadmap.md, which is markdown,
but you can start as well, with

86
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,110
a simple document, which can be
the first page of your project,

87
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,430
if you are thinking of building
a website, in the GitHub, it

88
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,440
could be a readme file, you
could also create issues. And

89
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,340
these issue can have labels, for
example, you can look at these

90
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,320
two examples. Again, as I said,
you're going to come back to

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,710
these slides, you will go
through it slowly, one by one,

92
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,770
and you will be able to look at
these examples. So I'm going to

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:13,800
open one example. Because we
have some time. So this is a

94
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,180
roadmap that Open Knowledge maps
on open discovery have written,

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,540
this is their road. This is what
it looks like they have a

96
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,290
motivation of what this project
is about. They give an

97
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,710
introduction to Open Knowledge
maps, and they list out all the

98
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,590
resources that they have
developed, what kind of services

99
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,410
they have, what kind of
infrastructure they have, what

100
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,740
kind of community engagement
plan they have, what openness

101
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,830
means to them, what do they
think their sustainability of

102
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,160
the project would be like? And
what is the governance, so this

103
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,970
is a lot of them might be quite
high level for a new project.

104
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,790
But if your project has existed
for a while, you might want to

105
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,170
also think about a product
detail. And then you have work

106
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,950
plan. And let's look at the work
plan. And the work plan. They

107
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,150
have clearly clearly written
what what are the main three

108
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,230
pillars for them are, they
explain each of them for each of

109
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,580
them, they actually provide what
kind of infrastructure that they

110
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,990
are using. And they have gone
into as much detail as it is

111
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,500
required for them to ensure that
their contributors know about

112
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,700
their project. So that this
might be quite detailed. Over

113
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,380
the next few weeks. We will also
share some examples with you in

114
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,030
the slack or in the notes. So
please have a look at all those

115
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,960
and I'm sure you might have your
own ideal project in mind. It's

116
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,480
a good chance for you to go back
to those projects and look at

117
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,180
how they're doing it and why
they're doing it that way. Okay,

118
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:51,990
so with that, I'll say that we
can finish this part
