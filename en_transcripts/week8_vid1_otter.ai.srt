00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
Unknown: Hi everyone, again,
thank you for the invitation.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,640
urban life science team. I am
very happy to be part of the

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,810
folks who bring some expertise
to the second urban life science

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,460
cohort. I will talk briefly
about urban education and

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,360
training today, most of my time
would go into presenting metal

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,940
sensors case study. Please bear
with me until slide five, if

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,030
you're wondering what that name
means. So I am Laura Seon, mid

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,930
career researcher from an
currently ad when Osiris

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,540
Argentina. However, what brought
me here today is my role as one

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,040
of my data associates, co
founders. These are metal

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,350
Celsius, and my theater handle,
in case you want to tweet about

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,460
this presentation, and thank
you, Sharon mccutchen for

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,660
sharing this beautiful picture
on unsplash so I could reuse it.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,170
Building on a great presentation
by color give it for the first

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,080
cohort in iOS. I will start by
giving a definition of urban

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,820
education according to open
education, global urban

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,480
education and compasses,
resources, tools and practices

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,380
that employ a framework of open
sharing to improve educational

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,690
access and effectiveness
worldwide. Still, building on

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,800
gallops presentation here, Open
Educational Resources must

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,120
follow the fair principal. This
means that resources should be

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,810
final accessible already. So
yeah, I'm missing their

23
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,750
interoperational here, that's
more for data. This the last bit

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,940
of reusable is key because
uploading your educational

25
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,030
resources to a public website
does not make them very usable

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,720
really. So open educational
resources require license

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:08,550
allowing reuse makes sharing.
And this is a slide five so here

28
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,630
it goes. The finishing of that
term metal associate our case

29
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,590
study today checks all the boxes
I'm I just mentioned in the last

30
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,740
slide in particular all the
resources developed by metal

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,480
associate are sharing. I shared
our shared to sorry, using a CC

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:34,050
BY 4.0 license. So the name
Madison says meaning Madison see

33
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,110
it can be translated from
Spanish to English as

34
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,300
meditating. Medicine Xia is an
initiative that teaches to teach

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,390
in Spanish last March with the
need to switch every class from

36
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,650
a person to online in Argentina,
where we don't know when in

37
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,700
person classes we ever assume
yet. This friends with whom we

38
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,280
have been working in the art
community and I co founded

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
Metallo sensia. Our mission is
to nurture a community of

40
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,530
Spanish speaking educators by
teaching concrete, evidence

41
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,160
based and student centered
educational methods. We

42
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,700
collaboratively develop open re
usable and accessible resources

43
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,270
to foster effective training
practices. We are heavily

44
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,550
inspired by the carpentries and
open education organization

45
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,120
worth checking out if you're not
familiar with it yet. I bet a

46
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,100
lot of you know about it here.
So you might be wondering why

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,000
there is a need for metal sensia
when there are so many open

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,090
educational resources about
teaching already available?

49
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,040
Well, on the one hand, most
state of the art resources and

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,760
communities around them are
majorly in English or our

51
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,750
English speaking communities. On
the other hand, English is an

52
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,560
enormous barrier in Latin
America. translations of

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,340
contents are not enough for
culturally responsible teaching,

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,210
meaning our learners where they
are in Latin America means to

55
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,350
not make assumptions about the
knowledge of technologies such

56
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,880
as zoom, slack or Google Docs,
and being conscious about

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,840
Internet access and
accessibility differences. There

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,650
is a ton of the ran leveling
work needed before meaningful

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,710
international integration is
feasible. Communities of

60
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,670
Practice are still a new concept
in our region. In mid March, the

61
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,340
need for all we have learned
from several international

62
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,480
communities of practice was more
evident than ever. We had the

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,780
knowledge, the experience and
the moral obligation to share it

64
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,410
ASAP.

65
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,100
So seven months later, our core
team of carpentries or our

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,880
studio certified trainers and
instructors added Nikolas

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,900
another carpentries trainer and
instructor. Our collaborators

68
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,610
teams, the team now includes 10
collaborators in three countries

69
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,800
and six different cities in
Argentina. They are our suite of

70
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,910
certified instructors carpentry
structures are not originally

71
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,180
knowledgeable, accessibility
experts. We are also blessed by

72
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:18,510
an international advisory team
that it's guiding us. We are not

73
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,500
only pictures in our website or
interact only through slack. We

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,980
also have periodic team
meetings. This is a picture of

75
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,880
part of our team during our last
monthly meeting, only eight of

76
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,260
us were able to join. Although
missing key folks, this is how

77
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,400
it looks to work together for
us. While talking while taking

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,850
this picture, we realize that
this is how it will always look

79
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,840
for us because Metro senses team
is geographically spread. And

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,900
our budget will not go into
meeting in person anytime soon.

81
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,750
meeting in person is not
currently a priority,

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,530
particularly because we know how
to function very well online.

83
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,520
This is great news not only for
medicine, but also for our

84
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,190
planet. among various
activities. We have our three

85
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,610
hour hands on workshop
introduction to teaching align

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,120
our 30 times, we completed a
carpenter's instructor training

87
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,220
for 19 participants at my home
are now instructors certified by

88
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,710
the carpentry. We are piloting a
two hour hands on workshop, and

89
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,340
how to use zoom to teach online.
This is the most common request

90
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,750
from our participants. Also a
three hour workshop for creating

91
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,410
interactive tutorials to teach
to code with art using the art

92
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:42,780
package learner will reach more
than 1200 500 Spanish speaking

93
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,370
teachers across 19 countries, we
have reached educators from all

94
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,030
over Argentina including
underserved rural areas. Our

95
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,350
learners teach mostly exactly
natural sciences, but also other

96
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,300
disciplines. We foster a
community through a 100% Spanish

97
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,450
speaking slack workspace where
we apologize when we share

98
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,200
materials in English. It
includes more than 300 members.

99
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,760
We are also active tweets and an

100
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,690
these 19 past include
contributions from persons who

101
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,040
are part of our community. We
also will community by working

102
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,980
together with other communities
and institutions at local,

103
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,730
regional and international
levels. Our current materials

104
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,600
have been repurposed to suit
audiences of early career

105

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,210
Latin American conference for
the use of art in research and

108
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,310
development. We also repurpose
our materials to encourage the

109
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,600
Spanish speaking our latest
community war while to continue

110
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,740
having events gatherings and
teaching online through pandemic

111
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,150
times. Finally, we hosted a
genuine generously carpentries

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,060
other communities include
Nadella and Argentine event and

115
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,810
community that shares our
principles and values and

116
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,710
sources are supported supporter
for the event this year. We also

117
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,230
learned metal sensor
infrastructure to cause the

118
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,580
launching of pilotis alto in
Bolivia. And for presentation of

119
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,210
several are related initiatives
from Latin America at use our

120
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,960
2020 and an international
diversity and inclusion panel

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:44,730
also at use our 2020. So in the
upcoming month, we keep thinking

122
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,900
globally while acting locally
considering the different

123
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,650
realities of Latin American
Spanish speaking educators.

124
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,160
However, one lesson we learned
is that metal sensor will not be

125
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,600
sustainable only on volunteer
time that we are actively

126
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,130
looking for funding and to
become fiscally sponsored. We

127
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,400
also plan to give developing
workshops to teach how to teach

128
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,950
programming bifen are good and
other open source and open data

129
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,270
science methods. We also plan to
measure our impact and publish

130
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,530
our experience openly.

131
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,810
All of our activities were
possible thanks to our team's

132
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,680
volunteer time and 1000 US
dollar grant from the open

133
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,250
bioinformatics foundation that
supports our words zoom Kala Lee

134
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,870
and other infrastructure. And in
this link, you can find more

135
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,800
information about Metallo
sensia. This is our English

136
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,270
version. So no worry, no Spanish
in that one that the rest of his

137
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,930
Spanish but we also have an
English version. So thank you

138
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,770
for your attention.
