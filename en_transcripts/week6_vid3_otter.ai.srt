00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Unknown: My name is Paul Andrea
marthinus, you can find me on

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,230
Twitter via my handle or kids
00. This presentation is open to

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,940
you by a creative commons CC by
four International. And I've

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,180
uploaded to fit chat. So I think
I tick all the boxes that Alex

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,100
just mentioned. Great. So from
the western, you just added on

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,880
to the MB hack. I hope some of
these are reproducing this

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,110
slide. It comes from the World
Bank, it was an analysis they

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:37,590
did with the Open Data handbook
and the World Bank survey. And

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,080
they mentioned that open data as
many things for different

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,610
people. So it's an opportunity
to share digital resources, make

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,940
the community participate and
empower them by giving them

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,920
access, giving them transparency
on how the data was collected,

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,320
and then share with with
everyone by having no

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,240
restrictions and making it
available. So just to expand on

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,560
that. I like to give you the
definition of what open data

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,110
means by the Open Data
handbook.org. They say that open

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,060
data is data that can be freely
used, reuse, and redistributed

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,270
by anyone. And on this little
cartoon on the right side, it

19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,760
says it's an unusually mutation
for you for anyone to use,

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,500
modify and enhance your work.
That's the way that we can build

21
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,460
on top of other people's work
and keep improving them. The

22
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,560
concept of open data is actually
nothing new. It comes from the

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,800
since internet started this some
guidelines that people should be

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,480
following that Tim berners Lee
put together trying to make it a

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:04,350
very simple step by step process
to make your data open as much

26
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,500
as possible. So the first thing
is whatever you want to share,

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,730
you can put it online, in would
have four months you have, but

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,780
under an open license. So we
Alex just mentioned, there's

29
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,080
different kinds of licenses,
depending if you have code or if

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,440
you have text, like in this
case, I'm using Creative Commons

31
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,220
for the license. Then if you
want to go a step farther you go

32
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,600
and make that data available in
a structured way. So for

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,650
example, you can put together
all your data collected in a way

34
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,610
that nobody can understand them.
Or you can categorize your data

35
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,330
and put it into different
sections. How is your process

36
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,440
collected? How do you clean your
data and how it's what's the

37
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,200
output of that data. The third
way is making this data once

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,780
it's out there, it's on the
internet, you have put it

39
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,810
together kind of in a
spreadsheet, for example, you

40
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,630
can opt to have a nonprofit, or
open format. For example,

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,040
instead of having Excel that not
everyone can open, you can have

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,530
that as a text file or a comma
separated

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,900
file.

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,700
So that other people who don't
have access to an Excel

45
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,900
spreadsheet software program,
they can open it with an open

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,560
source software program that
exists for other operating

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,890
systems. The fourth step is that
you who add a link or URL to the

48
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,330
node, what you're sharing, and
that is the URL. And we would

49
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,140
like to have this euro as a
permanent resource. So something

50
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,380
then it's not going to change
over time. And it's always going

51
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,480
to point to the original data
that you're sharing. Once you

52
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,920
have that you make very good
progress. And the last step that

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,880
you can make to contribute to
open data is to link your data.

54
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,730
So it's very unusual that you
have a data that comes by itself

55
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,440
stands alone and links to
nothing. So you have to try to

56
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,970
put some extra information about
how this data links to other

57
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,780
data. If you've collected from
other sources, if you've clean

58
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,410
it from other sources, if you
contributed with other people,

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,740
all those things are things that
you can link to your data and

60
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,120
you provide context of what the
result is. So with these steps,

61
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,190
you are helping everyone and
making it possible for others to

62
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,560
reuse your data in a much more
meaningful way. To continue with

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,950
this presentation, I'll touch on
this three points. The thing I'm

64
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,300
very important when you share
your data first is ethics. The

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,300
second one is how you link your
data a little bit more in

66
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,730
details, and then the fair data
principles. So first, for

67
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,990
ethics. A lot of people think
that the ethics code just at the

68
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,540
end so when you try to
communicate and do distributed

69
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,480
your data, you should be ethical
in what you're sharing. But

70
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,000
instead, I want you to remind
yourself that ethics comes from

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,360
the moment that you apply for
funding. Someone is paying for

72
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,860
this research, and they want
this research to be public or

73
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,980
know, what's the motivation for
that? How are you designing your

74
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,270
project? Are you being biased?
Or about your data collection?

75
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,340
How are you resourcing your
data? How is your analysis being

76
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,130
done? Are you influencing the
results of your analysis by any

77
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,130
process that you're taking? How
you interpreting the data? Are

78
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,350
you skipping some steps? Are you
trying to collect what goes in

79
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,880
for a better p value on your
results, all of that it's part

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,960
of the data ethics. So remember
that and think that ethics is

81
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,360
all the way in your data product
lifecycle. The other important

82
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,160
thing that I think why the open
data exists, it's to create

83
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,820
knowledge. And to create
knowledge, we have to understand

84
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,780
each other. So for that we use
standards. Also, we use the

85
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,820
syntax. So for example, I've
heard in a presentation about

86
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,840
the human genome where people
were uploading a lot of human

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,990
genomes that are not ECG,
correct, but they will some

88
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,140
people will name in hormone,
other people will mimic human,

89
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,590
other people will name a man,
there's so many words that

90
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,600
relate to the same thing. But a
machine will not know this, if

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,530
they're not part of vocabulary
or ontology. And to see the

92
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,370
difference, I would recommend
you to go into w three.org. To

93
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,700
see how you can build an
ontology where you can find

94
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,990
ontologies are already existent,
and how you can contribute to

95
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,460
those and name your data in a
reasonable way that has a

96
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,760
relationship that has context
and you provide the connection

97
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,780
to what you're sharing.

98
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,690
Last, but not least, the fair
guiding data principles. This is

99
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,050
also not a new concept. But
there was a published paper in

100
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:17,130
2016, about thinking all the
things you do as a researcher,

101
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,970
we usually have this little nice
picture of our paper that is two

102
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,020
or three pages long, that we
spend two or three years

103
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,380
collecting and cleaning and
putting together, right. So

104
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,100
there's a lot of work performed,
that it's not visible to the

105
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,540
public. And we want to emphasize
all of that we want to leverage

106
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,800
the work that you're doing, we
want you to have credit for the

107
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,910
work that you're doing. So
that's why the principles were

108
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,610
put together as a guideline. And
it has some steps and

109
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,090
recommendations that I've
mentioned before. And on this

110
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,060
presentation, you have some
links that I recommend you to

111
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,040
follow. So they go further or
explain them in Simple English

112
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,850
terms about what they are. Then
there's the fourth 11, fair data

113
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,000
principles group. If you want to
contribute, you can go there

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,470
and, and help. And a new
initiative that I'm also part of

115
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,170
the chain committee is fair for
research software. So initially,

116
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,490
the guiding principles were only
for data. And now we want to

117
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,630
have software for surface
citizen having the same

118
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,500
principles applied to software.
They relate a lot to the data

119
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,350
principles, but there's some
modifications that we need to

120
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,150
do. And you can also read that
paper towards first principles

121
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,820
for research software that was
published last year. Some

122
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,710
communities that are being part
of that I'm still part of that

123
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,050
you can go and look up for more
information on the Open Data

124
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,700
handled by the Open Knowledge
Foundation, the last OSL had a

125
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,000
presentation by one of the
members. There's a lot of

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,540
information in the digital
curation center, not only about

127
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,310
open data, but also licensing,
and many other topics. You will

128
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,590
come to have look this the
Forster open science that has a

129
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,620
lot of open materials that you
can reuse. It also has

130
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,200
tutorials, you can share them,
they're all attribution base.

131
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,310
They're open, as before the
Turing way that you might have

132
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,430
heard many times already. Then
there's also the open

133
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,360
conquerable conference that has
set later conferences around the

134
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,620
world. Now everything is online.
So you can also start one of

135
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,200
those in your locality. And for
the TOEFL, the topic of open

136
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,810
data. The research data
Alliance, I think is a very

137
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,260
valuable resource. It's a group
of volunteers around the globe,

138
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,920
that labels the open sharing and
reuse of data. There's so many

139
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,230
different topics out Welcome you
to be part of them. And as Alex

140
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,270
mentioned, if you want to start
using open data, what best to

141
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,900
put hands on into hackathon for
example, there's a lot of

142
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,750
challenges that you can be
solving social, economic, and

143
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:22,110
environmental, where Open Data
can help. With that, I'd like to

144
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:29,010
thank you for your attention.
This is also an open image by

145
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:35,760
patri. HostIn back. And the the
open data is just part of the

146
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,260
road to open science I think all
of you are following in. If you

147
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,290
have questions, you can contact
me by by Twitter.
