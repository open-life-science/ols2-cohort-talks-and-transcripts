00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
Unknown: Hi, everyone. I'm
Melissa. I'm now a training and

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,120
communications officer with
Australian buyer comments, but I

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,960
used to be at the FBI. But the
reason I'm here today is that I

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,470
have been quite heavily involved
with an alexian working group on

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,250
making training materials fair.
And some of the other people on

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,730
the call have also been involved
in that. So to begin with the

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,020
end, this project that I'm going
to talk you through has been a

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,980
massive collaborative effort.
It's started as a legacy of by a

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,060
hackathon project in 2018. And
then it was taken on by the

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,780
Alexia working group for making
for making training materials

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,700
fair, which led to the
publication of 10 simple rules

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,160
for making training materials
fair and plus computational

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,030
biology. And I'll share the link
to that with you in in the chat

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,980
and in the documents later on.
So I think Philips talk was

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,590
quite a nice segue into this
because he's already started to

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,580
talk about some of the types of
training materials. And when we

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,760
said about doing this work, we
first had to define really, what

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,620
are we talking about when we're
talking about training

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,310
materials. And we took a really
broad view of this of it being

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,960
any digital object that you use
in training. So this can be

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,230
PowerPoint slides, it can be
data sets, it can be PDF,

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,250
handouts, it can be whatever you
think of that you can use in

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,950
training, we excluded physical
things that you might use for as

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,490
fer is directed towards a
digital environment. Okay, so

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,060
why do we need to be fair when
we're thinking about training

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,760
materials. So the key thing that
you do as a trainer, when you

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,300
start to plan for your event is
to develop the materials that

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,020
you're going to present. And
when you do this, then some of

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,570
the common things that people do
is to go and look at what's

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,200
already out there for
inspiration. Once you've done

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,470
that, you might decide to build
your own materials. And you

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,710
might, or you might completely
reuse somebody else's materials

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,440
are just bits and pieces from
other China ours China's

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,310
material as well, because it
makes it faster. But it also

35
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,670
means that what you are teaching
is consistent with what other

36
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,340
people are teaching within your
field. And it makes it more

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,860
efficient. But what we've all
found as trainers as that this

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,310
can be quite hard. And in
particular, it's really hard to

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,940
find training materials. But
then it's also really hard to

40
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,390
understand what people have done
with those training materials

41
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,920
because there isn't enough
metadata to describe them. We've

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,890
also found that once you find
the materials, they can be

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,310
inaccessible. So you know, it's
there that you can't get access

44
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,310
to it, or they're not licensed
for reuse as well. Now, we

45
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,820
realized that these are
challenges that are also

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,390
apparent with data. And we knew
about the principles that

47
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,830
Philips just told us about. So
we decided to try and repurpose

48
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,070
those principles for the
purposes of training materials.

49
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,960
And this theory, lots and lots
of conversation and lots of

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,680
discussion has led us to
building these these 10 simple

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,160
rules or 10 simple steps towards
making training materials fit.

52
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,640
And they're really they're not
hard and fast rules, they're

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,820
more like guidelines to get you
thinking about what you need to

54
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,540
do. So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to walk through each

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,300
of these 10 steps at quite a
high level. And then if you want

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,970
to know about any of the
particular steps in more detail,

57
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,210
we can talk about that more as
well. So number one is to share

58
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,380
your materials, this is going to
sound really obvious, but it is

59
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,960
one thing that people don't
think about. And of course, if

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,690
you don't share your materials,
nobody else is going to be able

61
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,050
to find them. It's also really
important to to plan for sharing

62
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,140
your materials. So as you're
creating them think about

63
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,750
writing down those bits of
metadata and things that you

64
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,890
need in order to explain it to
other material. But also think

65
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,630
about where you're going to
share them and how that

66
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,530
influences the fairness of your
materials. And there are lots of

67
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,170
different places that you can
share your materials and denodo

68
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,920
as we just saw is one of those
places. GitHub is also a popular

69
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,080
place that lots of people have
been using recently. Okay, so

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,050
second step on the road to
fairness is to describe the

71
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,330
training materials properly. So
for this particular step, we

72
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,480
were more thinking about
structuring the metadata rather

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,720
than what goes into the
metadata. And this is really to

74
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,970
make it easier for search
engines to find and to index,

75
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,920
the content of your materials.

76
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,380
So one of the ways you can do
this is to use bio schemas. So

77
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,460
bio schemas have specifications
that have certain categories

78
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,850
that are associated with
training materials. The other

79
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,230
thing You can do is to use an
keywords from an ontology to

80
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,740
describe your materials more
consistently. So that within

81
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,730
your field, so say, I'm training
here in Australia and somebody

82
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,060
else's training over in the UK,
we're both describing training

83
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,770
materials on the same topic with
the same words. Within the

84
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,650
bioinformatics community, quite
a lot of people are using terms

85
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,430
from the EDM ontology. And you
can go and look that up on the

86
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,880
MLS ontology lookup service, if
you're more interested to know

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,510
what's in that. So So step
three, and this is going to be

88
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,210
sounding quite familiar from
what we've just heard is to give

89
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,380
your training materials a unique
identity. So one of the identity

90
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,920
persistent identifiers you can
use here is a do II. And often

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,470
if you're sharing through things
like zenodo, it will

92
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,580
automatically be given into your
line. Again, you can also

93
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,910
encourage the use of P IDs for
authors by using orchids. And by

94
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,520
doing this, you're making sure
that you get credit for the work

95
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,070
that you've done, and any
contributors are also getting

96
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,520
credit. And this helps build
your reputation as a trainer as

97
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,810
well. Okay, so step four is to
register your materials online.

98
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,440
Now, this might sound like the
same thing as step one that is

99
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,620
actually slightly different. So
in step one, we're talking about

100
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,380
getting your materials out as
uploading them somewhere.

101
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,550
Whereas this one is more about
collecting materials from the

102
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,150
same topic together into a
registry. So you're telling a

103
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,270
website that I have materials
out there, this is where you can

104
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,170
find them. So for
Bioinformatics, there's a couple

105
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,050
of different examples of this,
there's elixirs tests, and there

106
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,920
is also the goblet portal for
training materials. And they're

107
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,530
kind of aggregating all those
different training materials

108
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,100
together into one place so that
they're easier to find. And then

109
00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,510
they will link out to where they
are stored. Number five is to

110
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,100
define the access rules. So the
level of accessibility of

111
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,610
different materials can vary for
many different reasons. It may

112
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,030
be that your materials are, for
example, only accessible to

113
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,240
people who've paid for that
course. Now, that's completely

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,620
fine. As Phillip was saying, the
level of accessibility can vary,

115
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,980
you just have to be very clear
about how it varies and what the

116
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,600
rules for access are. And what
we recommend that you do is to

117
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,780
to write this in the metadata or
to even include it in a readme

118
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,780
file that goes alongside your
training materials. So people

119
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,840
can very clearly see whether or
not they can access the

120
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:44,190
materials and how they can do
it. Next step is to use an

121
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,360
interoperable format. This one I
think, was one of the most

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,330
controversial things that we
discussed when we tried to think

123
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,540
about what these are also, they
can see photos grinning, because

124
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,110
he was there for these
discussions. For training

125
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,920
materials, I think the format
that you choose really depends

126
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,240
on your context and what you
intend to use it for. However,

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,090
you should be aiming to use a
format that can be used in

128
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,870
different contexts and on
different operating systems. And

129
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,710
use a format that is editable if
you want to enable it to be

130
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,240
fair. So there's lots of
different formats out there. For

131
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,960
example, just for presentations,
you've got PDFs, PowerPoints,

132
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,500
and latex. And each of these
have different advantages and

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,270
different disadvantages, and
some are more adaptable than

134
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,350
others. If you want to have a
closer look at the advantages

135
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,650
and disadvantages of those types
of formats, then we have a nice

136
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,060
table in the paper that looks at
those in detail. also noted here

137
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,550
that there is now a trend
towards providing training

138
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,240
materials in markdown. It's
becoming very popular, and it

139
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:59,430
does have great uses in certain
contexts. Okay, so number seven,

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,590
is making the materials reusable
for trainers. And in contrast

141
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,010
the data what we're actually
doing it here is targeting

142
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,260
people rather than machines. So
for a trainer to be able to take

143
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,040
somebody else's materials and
reuse them, they need to be able

144
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,130
to understand what that material
was trying to deliver, why, and

145
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,080
how. And all of this information
needs to be included in the

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,190
metadata. And ideally, that
metadata could be structured as

147
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,350
well, we'd make it even easier
to find.

148
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,050
In order for trainers to be able
to reuse the materials as we saw

149
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,870
earlier as well, you need to
give it a license that allows

150
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,050
that reuse. So the Creative
Commons licenses are great for

151
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,260
this. And there are different
levels of licensing that you can

152
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,650
apply depending on your own
situation. So number eight,

153
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,430
there is another group of people
who might want to reuse training

154
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,030
materials and This is the
Chinese themselves. So when you

155
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,220
want to learn something for
yourself, but you don't have

156
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,820
time to go on a course, one
thing you might do is go out

157
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,880
onto the internet and look for
things that are already out

158
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,390
there. So that you can teach
yourself. I just saw your

159
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,030
stretching, I thought she was
very excited about that. That's

160
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:23,370
just stretching. Right? So for
trainees, they're coming at it

161
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,460
from a slightly different angle,
and they want to know as well

162
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,850
what the training is about. But
they want to know, specifically,

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,790
what are they going to get out
of this training, and what do

164
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,720
they need to know in advance, in
order for them for it to be the

165
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,680
right training for them. So in
your metadata of with your

166
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,740
training materials, you should
always be including learning

167
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,540
outcomes and prerequisites. And
as we're saying, again, again,

168
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,960
the way you write this is really
important, and you should aim to

169
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,310
be using a consistent format.
What's being recommended in the

170
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,790
training sphere, and in the
education world as well is to

171
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,570
use the format of an active
verb, ideally, from a Bloom's

172
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,580
ontology, or taxonomy rather,
plus a behavior, knowledge,

173
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,510
skill or ability. So for
example, if we were to apply

174
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,300
that to this presentation, we'd
say by the end of this

175
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,590
presentation, you should be able
to list which is your verb, the

176
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,700
10 simple steps to making
training materials fair, which

177
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,910
is the knowledge part of that
equation. Nine, so number nine

178
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,660
is training doesn't occur in a
bubble. When you're developing

179
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,320
training materials, you always
seek feedback from others, and

180
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,020
you always can welcome
contributions as well, it's

181
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,250
always very helpful, that there
are steps that you can take to

182
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,720
make this more open. So you can
start by telling people how they

183
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,810
can contribute to your
materials. And when you're doing

184
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,970
this to use a warm tone.
alongside your metadata you can

185
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,720
can include a contribution file,
and I'm pretty sure you learned

186
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,230
about this in one of the past
sessions. And in this year,

187
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,110
you're stating the rules for
participation and contribution.

188
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,630
So you're telling people how
they contribute what you want

189
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,630
control contributions on and
what they're going to get out of

190
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,920
it as well. Of course, if other
people are contributing to you

191
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,070
materials, you want to give
credit where credit's due, that

192
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:27,090
is only the fair thing in
another context. Okay, so I feel

193
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,270
like I'm speaking quite fast.
And we've come to number 10,

194
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,920
which is very important, as
well, and often forgotten is to

195
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,270
keep your materials out tonight.
It's great. If you're sharing

196
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,390
materials, and you're putting
them out there. However, the

197
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,930
materials go out of date. And
this is okay, if your materials

198
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,870
are out of date, and you don't
have time to update them, that's

199
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,500
fine. Just add a note to the
metadata saying that they've

200
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,080
been retired and there shouldn't
be used anymore for these

201
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,220
reasons. However, if you want to
continue to use your materials,

202
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,670
and you're updating them, make
sure that you're keeping track

203
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,760
of the versions and that it's
easy for people to identify,

204
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,680
which is the most recent version
as well. There's different ways

205
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,250
that you can do this and it's
some level it depends on where

206
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,630
you're sharing your materials as
well. And many people on the

207
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,530
call are going to be great
champions of GitHub for this as

208
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:29,130
well but there are other options
too. Okay, so that was quite a

209
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,340
quick whistlestop tour of the
kind of thinking that this the

210
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,950
elixir working group came to
when we put together the 10

211
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,090
simple rules 10 simple steps
towards making training

212
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,170
materials fair. If you have any
questions and we'll come to take

213
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,750
them happy to take them now.
Okay, talk about them in the

214
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,530
breakout rooms as well. Also pop
a link to the slide into the

215
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,800
paper in into the chat and to
the document in a moment.
