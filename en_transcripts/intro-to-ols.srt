1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
Unknown: Huge welcome. And we're
excited to be working with you.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,070
So what we focus on is helping
early stage researchers,

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,980
potential academic leaders, and
really anyone who has an

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,150
interest in open science
practice. So you don't have to

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,090
be an early stage career, if you
wants to still go through the

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,290
program, that's fine as well.
And one of our focuses is to

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,080
make sure that you become an
ambassador for open science. So

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,810
whilst we we have everyone
applying with a specific

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,690
project, so that you may be
working on, we hope that this

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,140
will actually apply to all
aspects of the science and the

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,540
research that you're working on.
And that hopefully, this will be

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,110
something you can also pass on
to others in the future. And

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,540
again, we can only really
advance where we're actually

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,440
working with with with other
people rather than against other

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,240
people and building on each
other's successes. But one of

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,760
the problems is that people are
often afraid of actually

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,600
sharing, we try and break down
as many barriers here as we can,

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,720
as well as some of the fears
that may or may not actually be

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,080
things that people tend to
encounter all that often. So

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,720
some some of these fears might
be being criticized or being

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:18,120
scoped. But we like to talk
about working openly without

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,240
feeling vulnerable, and without
worry about having to worry so

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,920
much about something about these
types of things. So we will be

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,090
working one step at a time to go
through some of these steps. So

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,610
you may have already looked at
the open life science syllabus,

26
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,680
in fact, if you've applied,
there's a very good chance

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,940
you've spent quite a long time
looking at this. But because we

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,560
have this over a whole 16 weeks
sort of means that we touch on a

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,050
few concepts, and then you have
a week or two to actually apply

30
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,620
it to your project. And then we
touch on more concepts. And this

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,620
means that rather than this
being a concentrated, you know,

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,960
one week program or something,
it means that you have a lot of

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,740
time to reflect and reapply and
work on things in between all of

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,680
the cohort calls. And then
there's also your mentors who

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,080
will speak with you on every
other week to actually chat

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,740
about how this is going and
reflect and figure out and act

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:14,550
as an external viewpoint. And
so, the cohort covers the cohort

38
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,340
based training. So sweet things
like today, today is largely an

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,580
intro, but we will go into a lot
more specific subjects over the

40
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,270
next 16 weeks, we also have the
one on one mentoring. And then

41
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,290
the hands on practice is really
up to us project lead. So this

42
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,690
is the part where you apply what
we've been learning to your

43
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,900
projects. And one thing that you
will see us talking about a lot

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,040
is the Mozilla open leadership
framework. So the open life

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,290
science was born as a child of
the Mozilla open leaders, that

46
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,690
doesn't run anymore, actually.
But they've left a lot of

47
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,330
amazing materials. You'll see
occasionally you may see Mozilla

48
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,270
and some of our slides or on
some of the handouts that we

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,620
provide. Because they launched a
bunch of different amazing open

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,710
leadership style programs. This
one specifically focuses on open

51
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,440
science. But this has also been
applied to AI and to hardware,

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,360
and to many, many other
different areas, that people are

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,400
actually applying the open
leadership framework and

54
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,480
basically as a way of
structuring building community,

55
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,820
and building collaboration and
pathways into the projects that

56
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,350
you're working on. And this is a
phrase that you will also see a

57
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,500
lot of the time, and we often
bold, different parts of it

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,920
depending on what we're actually
talking about. So I'll read it

59
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,280
out, open it as design, build
and empower their projects and

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,910
communities for understanding
sharing and participation and

61
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,210
inclusion. So depending on the
lesson that we may be teaching

62
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,120
in any given week, we may be
talking about the empowering, or

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,490
they'll be talking about the
designing or some other parts.

64
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,730
So you'll see this repeated a
lot but with a different

65
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,380
emphasis each time as we go
through. And this is part of the

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,570
Mozilla open leadership
framework. So this is again, a

67
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,020
slide you may see a lot, we will
highlight different boxes within

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,430
this or different bullet points
within this as we go along. But

69
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,860
it just sort of gives you an
idea of some of the focuses that

70
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,130
we look into. So we look at
participation and inclusion and

71
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,830
different ways that we can build
that into the program and

72
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,220
empower people. We look at ways
that we can build sharing into

73
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,610
the program. And we also look at
ways that we can design so that

74
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,640
people understand what's going
on effectively. And so some of

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,280
the different roles of open
science communities are some of

76
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,130
the different things that we
will touch upon over the next

77
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,390
few weeks will include sharing
your data. We will talk about

78
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,720
sharing your source code if you
have source code, so we're not

79
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,890
expecting everyone to do so. But
some of you may do so. Equally,

80
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,650
we talk about about sharing
hardware, but again, it's fine

81
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,150
if you don't have hardware,
these are just some of the

82
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,090
different things that you may
encounter. And it's also good to

83
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,290
be aware of as well.

84
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,630
Now we talk about dissemination
such as sharing up papers and

85
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,990
protocols, the more traditional
ways that that can be open

86
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,620
access, or if you're sharing
your results early. That's pre

87
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,630
printing. I think that's
actually been highlighted a lot

88
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,260
recently with COVID, perhaps
preprints have become a lot more

89
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,220
common and in the spotlight than
they used to be. We talked about

90
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,120
sharing with us your papers,
sharing training, such as open

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,030
education, and also
collaborating openly with a

92
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,750
public. Citizen Science may not
always be pinpointed as a method

93
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,570
of open science. But it
definitely does involve a lot of

94
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,350
openness. And also just
generally networking and

95
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,930
connecting with others in your
fields. And so these are a few

96
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,820
of the things that we cover,
it's definitely not the only

97
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,580
things we cover. That's one of
the things to look forward to

98
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,710
over the next few weeks, we'll
also invite a lot of guest

99
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,650
speakers to speak on these
specific topics. One of the most

100
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,650
important premises of open life
science is that openness should

101
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,130
be built in by design to what
you're doing rather than by

102
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,040
accident, or by a default. And
to explain why that is. So this

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,620
is a very sort of tech oriented
explanation. But looking at 160

104
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,970
tech companies. This study
actually found that the level of

105
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,970
strategic intent and openness
tended to correlate with market

106
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,530
performance, or to make that
slightly less techie sounding.

107
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,020
Basically, when you
intentionally design the ways

108
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,810
that people interact with you,
and the ways that people join

109
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,600
your community, and the ways
that people continue to

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,880
participate in your community,
it tends to be a lot more

111
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,210
effective, then if you simply
put something online and say,

112
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,590
Please come. So we try and focus
on building these effective

113
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,190
useful, inclusive communities
that actually are designed to

114
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,380
have people participating and
enjoying that participation. But

115
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,720
yeah, design openness and your
work and don't let it be a

116
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,830
thoughtless default.

117
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,800
So

118
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,860
chief positive culture change,
yes. Okay. Right. So one thing

119
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,110
that we're looking at also is
allowing you to achieve the

120
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,780
positive culture change within
your community. So we don't want

121
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,330
to just accept the status quo
and some places that may be

122
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,690
things aren't open or in other
places that the opening open

123
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,160
communities aren't necessarily
inclusive or empowering. So we

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,150
like to encourage that

125
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,500
we share a leadership we share a
vision and we push towards the

126
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,100
things that are actually
meaningful. And I think that's

127
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,330
everything for the intro.
