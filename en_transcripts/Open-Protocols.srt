1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Unknown: So talk about open
protocols, and really open

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,180
methods as a whole within the
context of open research. So

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,870
when you think about research we
have researchers doing in this

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,210
instance, he has some kind of
lab research, but it may not be

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,780
lab research. And we do quite
well. And there's been a lot of

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,510
initiatives about making sure we
have access to the research

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,040
papers, to the code and the data
and even the citations, but

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,700
there hasn't been anywhere near
the same level of focus on

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,910
making sure that we actually
have open methods all the time.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,570
So whatever is in the paper, if
the papers open access, then

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,930
you'll have access to what part
of methods is presented in the

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,730
paper. But that may not actually
be very comprehensive. And so if

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,790
we start thinking about
reproducibility of research, and

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,380
what it is that it's important
to have as open for research,

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,770
the data is great. But if you
don't know how you actually

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,190
derive the data, it's not as
helpful as you think in terms of

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,010
actually figuring out how it was
generated and what it means

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,310
because you don't necessarily
know how it was generated. As

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,840
lubei. Why should we care. And
reproducibility in research has

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,800
had a lot of really bad, bad
press in recent years. Some

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,580
people talk about crisis of
reproducibility. I'm not a big

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,120
fan of the crisis terminology,
because I think this is

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,230
something that we can easily
address. But it's clearly if not

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,800
a crisis, it's still a big
problem. So these tweets that

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,130
I'm showing kind of exemplify
the issue. So in the one in the

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,490
center, the person is biologist
was looking for a protocol in a

27
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,000
published paper. And that paper
cites an earlier paper. And the

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,370
other paper cites on earlier
paper, which cites another

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,000
earlier paper, and this is going
to be pre online content for the

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,160
most part, and then maybe
eventually, you hit a paywall,

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,520
and you just can't access that
information. So in that

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,730
instance, this researcher was
getting very frustrated. And so

33
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,360
the, the tweet shows this really
nicely as they tossed the laptop

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,050
out the window. It may be that
previous experimental

35
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,710
information only in the real
kind of details of it might only

36
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,950
be in someone else's lab, but
from years before, and that

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,790
might have had many coffee
spills, or being torn or lost or

38
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,640
just be illegible, essentially,
by the time you come to look at

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,040
it. But that you know, and
scrolling through someone else's

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,160
handwritten notes is not a task,
clicking that anyone would

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,990
relish it thinking about doing.
But it's not just biological

42
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,710
sciences. So the tweet on the
right is trying to physicists to

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,210
hit exactly the same problem of
trying to get to information

44
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,780
about how devices were
fabricated. And conventional

45
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,420
methods in the end was the
answer, which is not helpful to

46
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,860
anybody particularly. And there
have been some big initiatives

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,970
in recent times to see if
researchers could replicate and

48
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,600
reproduce some of the results
from some published studies. So

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,170
this is a big study by the OSF
Tim Harrington at the OSF and

50
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,900
they, they set out to try and
replicate and reproduce the

51
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,880
results that were arrived at in
50 published papers about cancer

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,080
research, as this quote here
shows, which is from the

53
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,860
Atlantic a really nice article
in The Atlantic by Ed young. And

54
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,550
it turned out that it was really
hard to find any of the details

55
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,490
or sufficient amount of
information about the methods in

56
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,910
those papers in order to
reproduce them. So the part that

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,390
I've bolded that often, those
recipes are incomplete, missing

58
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,290
out important steps, details or
ingredients. And in some cases,

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,430
the recipes aren't described at
all. One of the researchers

60
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,800
actually called this a hopeless
slog. And the the initiative was

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,100
stopped after they'd only tried
18 out of the 50 studies,

62
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,680
because it was just impossible.
And it was proving incredibly

63
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,920
expensive as well, to actually
try and perform these

64
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,820
replication studies. So long
story short, is there's a big

65
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,460
problem actually getting to the
methods information about how

66
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,940
people were performing their
research. And that's where

67
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,180
protocols.pi o comes in, which
is the company that I work for.

68
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,870
So we are a for profit, but the
content that we publish is all

69
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,350
open access. And our mission is
really simple. It's a make it

70
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,830
easy to share method details
before, during and after

71
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,630
publication. And it's completely
free to use as well if you're

72
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,510
publishing your content, so
anyone can come sign up for an

73
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,410
account and put in the details
of their experiments, their

74
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,160
protocols. And it looks like a
recipe I'll show you in a

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,120
moment. And it's really very,
very user friendly. So if anyone

76
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,660
hasn't had a look, that URL at
the top with slash welcome is a

77
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,250
good place to start to poke
around in there. And it's really

78
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,490
versatile. It was started out
for lab, bench work biological

79
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,370
sciences, but people use it now
in all research disciplines

80
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,000
pretty much.

81
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,010
And here's an example of what
one looks like. So when it's

82
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,770
published, it pretty much does
look like a recipe but also a

83
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,320
little bit like a publication.
So at the top here, you can

84
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,380
hopefully see there's a dry on
this published, published

85
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,890
article. So that means that
you've got a permanent URL link

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,060
to a pub initial version that
will stay static. And it's the

87
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,340
implement sure that's used for
all kinds of publishing

88
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,050
research. Essentially. These can
be your your protocols, you can

89
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,510
keep them private to you don't
need to make them public and

90
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,690
give them do it. So you can work
on them with your colleagues and

91
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,630
fiddle faddle around as you
develop them and optimize them,

92
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,660
share them with your team, as
you're working on making them

93
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,790
perfect, before you're ready to
publish them. They are amazing

94
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,520
for reproducibility. They're so
rich in the metadata that can be

95
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,160
added. And people can when
they've been published, if they

96
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,460
repeat an experiment, they can
take, they can kind of press

97
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,100
this works for me button, which
shows that someone else has

98
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,720
managed to replicate the study.
It's incredibly interactive,

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,690
people can comment so it's great
for teamwork, others can comment

100
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,620
and access and there can be full
on discussions on the protocol

101
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,190
questions about it. And what's
happening for entrepreneurs to

102
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,260
try and move. videos around
because I'm blocking the slides

103
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,950
for myself. And the do II is
something that you can drop into

104
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,100
your research article. And I'll
show you how you might do that

105
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,830
in a minute. But what's really
brilliant about that is that you

106
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,920
can also create new versions. So
after you've published your

107
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,510
protocol, if you spot a mistake
down the line and want to update

108
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,090
it or clarify something, it's
become clear, it's not very easy

109
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,900
for someone to follow, then you
create a new version. And if

110
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,220
people follow the link from the
published paper, they will see

111
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,070
that there's a new version. So
in I'll just give you a couple

112
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,340
of examples of papers with
protocols in them. So this is a

113
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,290
plus genetics paper actually
contains links to 42 individual

114
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,320
protocols. So when you've got a
really method, heavy paper, you

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,710
can create a protocol for every
single one of those. And so each

116
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,800
of these green do I links in the
materials and methods of the

117
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,640
paper points to its own
individual protocol and

118
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,580
protocols to it. And we always
have the journal article link in

119
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,160
there as well. So the two things
are really well interlinked with

120
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,050
one another are 42 individual
ones is a lot, a better way of

121
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,590
doing that might have been to
create a collection. So this is

122
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,330
another example, for a plus
biology paper, where the authors

123
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,210
did exactly that they made a
collection of protocols, and at

124
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,910
the top of their materials and
methods, they link to the

125
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,740
collection goi in protocols.io.
And when you follow that link,

126
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,940
you get taken to this screenshot
that's on the right, which is

127
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,970
telling you exactly what I
mentioned is possible before

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,390
that there's a newer version of
the collection available. So

129
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,500
that means the authors have made
some changes and updated it. And

130
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,010
if you click through, you can
see the newer version. What's

131
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,610
also really nice is that you
have very easy ability to

132
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,970
compare versions. So if you want
to see what it was that they

133
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,420
changed, you'll be able to do
that. And it works just like

134
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,470
really a word track change,
where you can see the two side

135
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,890
by side, and highlighted text of
the pieces that have been

136
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,450
updated and changed. So I call
this dynamic permanence because

137
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,720
you can have your published
paper in a journal with the link

138
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
to the protocol. But because you
can update the protocol really

139
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,240
easily. The di gives you this
permanent link out to a much

140
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,720
more dynamic document that can
be really a living document and

141
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,350
you can update it. But also
means you don't have to go to

142
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,620
the publisher for a correction.
If you realize there's a mistake

143
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,900
in the method after you've
published it, you can simply

144
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,240
layer on a new version in
protocols IO.

145
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,090
And why they would you do it
this way, rather than having a

146
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,060
you know much more detailed
materials and methods. I think

147
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,890
it's just it's so much richer to
use an online tool that's more

148
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,370
dynamic. So another user can
come in once you've published

149
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,160
your protocol, and run it
actually run through the

150
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,680
protocol in a step by step
manner, which is what this

151
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,730
little movie shows here. You can
add figures and photos and

152
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,020
videos kind of how too much more
of a step by step guide on how

153
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,390
to run the protocol, the kinds
of things that you'd never be,

154
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,360
you wouldn't even be allowed to
put them into a research paper,

155
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,250
you can make this much more of a
how to guide. And it's just has

156
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,070
the capacity to hold a lot more
granular information about

157
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,820
reagents, equipment, specific
tips and tricks on how you made

158
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,420
it work. Maybe it took you a
really long time to work out the

159
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,510
method of kind of shaking and
temperature change and things to

160
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,200
do to make a step of a protocol
work. And there's the

161
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,740
versioning. And it's really just
much better suited than writing

162
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,710
a narrative paragraph that you
would have as materials and

163
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,760
methods in the paper. But also
it's always open access. So I

164
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,060
mean, we are moving towards a
more open access world for

165
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,330
manuscripts, but right now
they're not all open. But if

166
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,240
you've chosen to make the
methods open, at least if the

167
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,480
paper ends up paywalled people
will still be able to get to the

168
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,360
method details without having to
worry about accessing a journal

169
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,020
article. And we have done some
really good kind of community

170
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,390
workspaces which are amazing
actually. And this one was

171
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,620
really organic and it was a neat
idea to create this Coronavirus

172
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,340
method development community,
right at the start of 2020 when

173
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,690
we started receiving submissions
about Coronavirus, various

174
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,370
different techniques, sequencing
or viral load on all sorts of

175
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,370
different things. And we created
this community is probably the

176
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,180
largest growing one and fastest
growing one we've had very

177
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,430
organically so. So it's amazing
to see how thin kind of find

178
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,950
like minded scientists working
on similar things and create

179
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,440
really a huge resource in this
open way. That's really I mean,

180
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,370
the pandemic is, at least the
silver lining is shining a huge

181
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,640
spotlight on the need for more
open science and understanding

182
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,490
and sharing of information as we
make advances as quickly as

183
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,010
possible. And so we were
thrilled to be able to support

184
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,800
these efforts and had our
editorial team helped pull in

185
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,610
protocols when scientists didn't
perhaps have time to do that.

186
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,760
And making the methods protocols
open on their own, makes them a

187
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,030
lot more discoverable
independently of the manuscript.

188
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,270
So the example I'm showing here,
the top left tweet was someone

189
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,430
looking for a protocol to do
with RNA extraction from primary

190
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,240
cortical neuron cultures. So
neuron cells, brain cells, after

191
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,830
several tweets, a UCSF postdoc,
I think it was suggested a

192
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,110
protocol that was on
protocols.io. And actually, when

193
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,920
you click through, you see that
that protocol came from a Giga

194
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,250
science paper, and it was a
paper on three spined

195
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,990
stickleback parasites. So it's
pretty unlikely that a

196
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,220
connection would have been made
between neuron cultures, brain

197
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,060
cells, and someone's work on
stickleback parasites, fish

198
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,810
parasites, without that method
being pulled apart in a modular

199
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,250
way outside of the paper itself.
So sort of this, this modular

200
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,060
approach to open science has
really facilitated discovery and

201
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,610
also research connections with
people who use similar

202
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,360
methodologies, but in completely
different contexts. So having

203
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,450
that as an open piece of
research on its own as a

204
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,330
research output that's
important, independently of

205
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,480
everything else, has made a big
difference in some instances for

206
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,930
people getting the right
feedback on what they should do,

207
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:28,380
basically. So yeah, I mean, I'm
a huge Open Science advocate all

208
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,500
around. And really, anything you
share, like this can accelerate

209
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
science, increase
discoverability,

210
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,260
reproducibility, help you make
good research connections,

211
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,980
enables the reuse. And it really
does enhance the value of the

212
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,850
research, there's really not a
negative reason, I think or

213
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,200
negative outcome from sharing
methods this way. And it's and

214
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,110
it helps with the stewardship of
research output too. So within a

215
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,410
lab, often, it's said that your,
your most likely future

216
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,130
collaborator will be you in six
months time. So if you store the

217
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,610
details in a much better format
than your own scribbled lab

218
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,550
notebook, you're actually making
life easier for yourself in the

219
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,390
future, too. We have a lot of
support, I realize I'm running

220
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,090
out of time from journals and
publishers and funders, and also

221
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,650
institutions, who also recommend
people use protocols that I owe.

222
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,390
So we're very happy to help
people if they're interested in

223
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,660
using the tool. And it's only a
small company, Lenny, who people

224
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,170
may or may not know is our
founder. And Anita has been

225
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,280
there for a while too. And it's

226
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:41,160
Thank you very much. Now, many,
many questions I'm getting at,

227
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,270
I'm quite aware of time, but
that is that folks are really,

228
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,670
really enthusiastic about what
you've said. And there are

229
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,010
questions about integration
about DUIs. versioning. So if

230
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,590
you if you could take a bit of
time, sorry, I have to ask this.

231
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,900
But yeah, if you could take a
bit of time on the hacker days

232
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,120
and maybe put some answers
there. That would be really,

233
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,680
really helpful for us.

234
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,490
We don't have to go ahead and do
that after this. That's an

235
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:17,970
impromptu so much. Thank you.
Yeah, so I'm gonna pass to y'all

236
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,260
for the closing.

237
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,030
I've managed to find the unmute
button in time. Okay, so this

238
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,350
has been jam packed full, but
really, really quite an exciting

239
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,430
call. I'm in love with how on
fire the questions were also for

240
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,170
this last talk. So for now, we
did have a fourth speaker

241
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,470
planned, we wouldn't have had
time for them even if they had

242
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,700
been able to make it. But
thankfully, we have a video so

243
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,500
right now online for four five
of the hack MD. We suggest just

244
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,470
hop over when you have some time
that doesn't have to be now and

245
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,770
just have a look at bastions
talk about citizen science which

246
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,190
is another open The science
method that's really important.

247
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,980
And apart from that, we actually
have a an optional cohort course

248
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,850
next week for self care and ally
skills. I know we normally have

249
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,510
a week off in between. But next
week, we have another call. We

250
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,490
will send out more info about
that. But you should have

251
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,740
received the calendar invite the
heck MD has been a pain in the

252
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,120
rear today. I'm really sorry
about that. We are going to

253
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,400
evaluate what's going on and
figure out whether it's still

254
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,390
the best option. And there is
more room for any other feedback

255
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,850
if you want to throw any
feedback right at the very, very

256
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,070
bottom of the document if
there's any feedback you'd like

257
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,730
to share, but we are four
minutes over so I am going to

258
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,090
say thank you very much. It's
been delightful, and we will see

259
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:51,540
you again later. Bye. Oh and
thanks so much. Thank you
