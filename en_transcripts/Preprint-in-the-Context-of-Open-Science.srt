1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
Unknown: My name is Omar from
Africa Chi cheery currently

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,780
based in Malaysia. We are here
to share with you what a

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,800
preference is. And in the
context of open science.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,120
Particularly my talks will be
focused more on the African

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,130
preference Saba, which is Africa
archive, which is the largest, I

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,310
mean, the only African preprint
server that we have. I am

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,340
actually a PhD student recently
got my PhD two months ago. I'm

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,940
affiliated with Africa archive,
being a moderator there and also

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,180
a bioinformatics coordinator
with science, communication,

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,060
health Nigeria, and also a
secretary to the Nigerian

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,920
bioinformatics and genomics
network. Before start, Ellie

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,000
just wants to share with you
what the preprint servers are.

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,230
The preprint servers actually
called a cluster of computers,

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,970
where scientists or researchers
are like, from different

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,990
disciplines up and share them,
their manuscripts publicly

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,610
available to community for
accessibility. So we do have

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,070
different kinds of Saba based on
the disciplines that you fall

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,570
in. The most popular ones, if
you are in biology is the bio

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,590
archive, which is based in
united states currently been

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,240
hosted by called herbosophy
laboratories. And you can choose

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,400
from where you wanted to deposit
based on your fields beat

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,570
pharmacology, pathology,
biology, microbiology can choose

23
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,450
the, the preference you may want
to submit your manuscript to. We

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,150
also have are the kind of
archive that holds natural

25
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,210
sciences like Mathematics and
Computer Sciences, as well as

26
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,820
quantitative biology. And in the
context of medical lines, we do

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,010
have med archive, which covers
those in public health and

28
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:13,260
Occupational and Environmental
Health, they usually the

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,420
positive manuscripts, they're
wild. For chemistry, they have

30
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,280
Chem archive, where you can also
deposit your research work.

31
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,790
While in the African continent,
we have Africa archive, where we

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,260
accept all kinds of
publications, as well as data

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,920
sets in the print language
within the continent of Africa.

34
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,120
This is so because some
scientists in Africa

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,690
particularly they do a kind of
reset with their languages,

36
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,660
local languages, and those
languages timeout actually

37
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,190
visible. Because some of the
journals that are published are

38
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,250
within the African countries are
mostly not online, they're

39
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,930
actually being printed in
hardcopy forms. So we thought of

40
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,320
coming up with this applicant
archive so that we can help

41
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,420
scientists to discover more
African scientists for maybe

42
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,710
collaborations and visibility.
So what is a preference? A

43
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,040
preference is actually a
complete scientific documents

44
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,200
that you may have a manuscript
so to call back, you can

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,990
publicly share our make it
available online freely, to be

46
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,960
accessible by communities of
scientists and researchers

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:40,410
alike. And it has some actually
associated benefits. Like you

48
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,730
can get cited before your
manuscript is being rebuilt in

49
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,180
the journals. You can also be
exposed people will get to know

50
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,430
you, especially nowadays that
most of the free prints they

51
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,030
usually have a Twitter handles
are each day, share your

52
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,420
research online, and people will
get to know you get to know your

53
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,290
publications. And you get you
will likely get funders and

54
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm saying to be collaborators
as well. And you can also get

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,180
some feedback. If you get I
mean, if the paper maybe need

56
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,560
some corrections or other
things, scientists will give you

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,100
some kind of feedback before
your manuscript is clearly built

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,090
by the journals that you
submitted to. And also it will

59
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,280
be freely available and having a
DUI. You can get cited as I

60
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,670
mentioned. So we have free
prints repositories. They

61
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,990
actually basically divided into
two which preference and pause

62
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,250
prints. The name implies,
preference is just the complete

63
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,190
manuscripts that you have an
publicly shared before peer

64
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,220
reviewed journals, while the
first print is actually research

65
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,910
articles, that is peer reviewed
and accepted for publications.

66
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,680
So I want to make an emphasis
that A preprint publishing a

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,930
preprint is not actually
published in journals. So, you

68
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:14,370
may want to like, check out
romea to check whether it is

69
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,280
allowed by the journal that you
wanted to submit your manuscript

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,330
is allow you to submit the
buttons of your paper in a

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,100
preference others are not. So it
is actually advisable for

72
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,840
scientists to make use of this
opportunity is freely online,

73
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,080
you can check it and make use of
the website ShareFile romea. And

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,950
then you can keep the titles of
the journals, maybe you can key

75
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,100
in maybe something like genome
biology or nature dependence on

76
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,910
the targeted journals that you
wanted to submit your manuscript

77
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,840
to. And it will give you the
details policy with which the

78
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,620
journals is having so that it
will guide to whether to submit

79
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,880
your manuscript to preference or
not. So there is a number of

80
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,160
those African as preprint
servers around which are

81
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,690
basically being a partnership
with Open Science Center for

82
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,710
Open Science, there are options
infrastructure, and there are

83
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,450
regionals and some discipline
specific reference repositories.

84
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,340
So, you can see Africa archive
is also known among the open

85
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,740
source infrastructure around. So
in Africa archive, what we do is

86
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,860
basically, we we provide a
platform for submissions of

87
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,760
multiple publications format. As
I mentioned before, you can

88
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,780
submit your data set your
presentations, your proposals

89
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,020
and your manuscript as well or
even review papers, because we

90
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,440
got to realize that some
preference like by archives,

91
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,140
they don't accept to submitted
proposals or to submit a review

92
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,590
paper or something like that.
But in African archive, we allow

93
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,730
scientists around the African
countries to submit these kinds

94
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,600
of words, because we want to
make it we want to make them

95
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,740
globally known, and people get
to know them. So they can have

96
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,510
collaboration sometimes. So we
also promote the use of local

97
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,880
languages. In that, we do have a
kind of if we have researched

98
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,240
with the local language, we make
sure that we translated the

99
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,580
abstract into English passion so
that global scientific community

100
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,440
can have access. We also build
collaborations and increase our

101
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,460
current research visibility
across the gloves, also built

102
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,670
and customized to fulfill the
needs of African researchers.

103
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,570
And we do all these in
partnership with zenodo, Open

104
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,350
Science Framework and open
publications as well as signs up

105
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,810
and to us. It's like our own
repository before we built our

106
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,490
own personal repository. We do
that to increase visibility and

107
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,870
discoverability, across the
Africa and globally. Together,

108
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,220
we also have a partnership with
fraserview. Science upon PCI for

109
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,430
reviewing the contents of the
manuscript that is submitted to

110
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,230
Africa archive, recently have
also partnership with fiction

111
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,150
and public knowledge,

112
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,940
public knowledge project. So
what we accept in African

113
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,090
archives, we allow African
scientists based in the

114
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,380
continent of Africa to submit
their work to also allow African

115
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,620
scientists who are currently
please like me at other

116
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,400
institutions outside Africa to
also submit their manuscripts

117
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,880
there. And also non African
scientists who report on

118
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,200
research conducted in African
territory, preferably with

119
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,580
African co authors listed and
then we also allow non African

120
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,360
scientists who report on
research related to African

121
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,620
Affairs. So here Our team of
curators and community

122
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,350
developers, as well as site
maintainence, who are actually

123
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,260
maintaining the upper concave
side. And we also have a lot of

124
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,720
advisory boards, we have Joyce
who is the the executive

125
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,870
director of of training for
psycho science in sorry,

126
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,110
Training Center in
communications in Africa. So we

127
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,950
have Mahmud who is the Executive
Director for science

128
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,780
communication, hope and African
literacy science network, whom

129
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,900
we put in place as both advisory
boards to the to be given some

130
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,950
kind of advice and directions on
African archive. So we have

131
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,000
multiple channels of
communications, in which you can

132
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,380
Get in touch with us. If you are
from Africa or if you are

133
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,340
African researchers, you can get
in touch with us through our

134
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,600
Twitter handles, email address.
We also have a slack channels

135
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,710
where you can get in touch with
us by institutions. Are we also

136
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,050
looking for collaborations from
other institution?
