1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Unknown: We'll be talking about
the release. But first, I will

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,740
introduce myself. My name is
Natasha Kozak and a community

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,400
manager at the Netherlands
Science Center. My background is

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,980
life sciences, cell biophysics,
and bioinformatics. And for a

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,710
while I've been research
software engineer. So I've been

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,190
developing research software,
and for the world for a while

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,790
now, I'm the community manager
in the area of research,

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,790
software engineering. So I
usually help research software

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,720
engineers connect to their
communities and help them help

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,170
them with their projects. And I
guess that's why I'm talking

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,400
about the readme files, because
that's part of the things how do

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,750
you interact? Or make the
interaction better with the

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,260
community that is interested in
your software? Or how do you

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,850
make or get your community
interested in your projects. And

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,680
so from this very short talk,
we'll learn how to use the

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,080
readme to communicate
information of your project

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,220
effectively, how to write clear
description of the project,

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,890
which is very important, and
it's actually quite difficult.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,880
Despite the wording, I think
it's easy to not realize that

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,090
we're using jargon, or we're
making things more complicated

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,650
because of our background. And
that we know much more than

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,720
other people. And I do. And
we'll show some examples are

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,730
good examples of README files.
And I guess your assignment will

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,330
be to either revise or improve
or start your README file for

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,420
your project. And so again, we
have this matrix of, of how,

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,160
where things are in the or less
project. So this is part of

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,400
build for understanding, it's
about communicating things about

28
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,390
your project. It's about
facilitation, collaboration is

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,940
about facilitation, maintenance,
and helping with the project

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,340
management. And so the readme is
like a dorm app for your

31
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,850
project. It's the first thing
that people will see when they

32
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,820
go to GitHub, they go to your
GitHub page of the project.

33
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,090
That's what they see the the
content of the of the readme

34
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,200
file. So this is like your
unique opportunity to get to

35
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,900
make a good impression. It's
like the the first impression

36
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,490
when you make when you met meet
someone first time. So this is

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,510
when your potential contributors
or users are going to eat your

38
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,200
project. And that's why it's
very important that they don't

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,530
get discouraged when they see
it, but they actually get

40
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,500
interested. So how can we make
it happen? And but first, what

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,430
actually is the readme. And the
reason is, it's a text file,

42
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,920
usually. And it's, it's found in
the root directory of your

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,930
repository. So and all of you
are working now on GitHub, with

44
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,350
your projects. And when you
create a project, GitHub will

45
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,770
automatically create a readme
file for you based on the

46
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,560
information that you provided
when you created the project. So

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,410
there will be a header which
will be a name of your project.

48
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,470
And then there will be a short
description, the description of

49
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,610
the put in when you created the
project. So I guess you already

50
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,320
started with a readme file, it's
usually all in caps. So all in

51
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,700
caps README, it could be written
in dot txt, or readme.mark.md,

52
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,870
which stands for markdown and
markdown files are automatically

53
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,160
rendered on GitHub in a nice
way. And they give you more

54
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,960
possibility to, to add some
design things in your README

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,440
over the text files, simple text
files. Yeah, and as I already

56
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,740
said, this is the first thing
that people will see. And so

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,010
what's in the readme? If there
should be a description of what

58
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,020
is your project about why is it
important, and who is the

59
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,050
audience of the project, and
wonder mode, what makes your

60
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,010
project special or exciting,
like why people would should get

61
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,330
excited about it, and how they
can get started either to use it

62
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,620
or collaborate with you or to
contribute to the project. And

63
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,510
where they can find the key
resources to like start the

64
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,740
journey with your project.

65
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,280
And you can use the open canvas
to start your README file. And I

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,920
will show some examples and
examples of the things that you

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,990
can add to make your reading
more effective. This is the

68
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,230
example from the several models
up and you see here. There is

69
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,970
the in in large letters there is
the name of the project. And

70
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,730
then there is the vision of the
project we already like it's

71
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,820
like the first thing you see is
the name and the vision of the

72
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,250
project. So it gives you the
already the perspective what

73
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,970
what is this about? And then
there's there's this very

74
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,730
welcoming message. And there are
some links to more resources to

75
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,590
find out to learn more about the
project. And usually also have,

76
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,370
so the name, the vision, the the
welcome message, project

77
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,100
description, these are all the
things that we need in the

78
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,550
readme file, you can also add
information how to contribute

79
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,800
how to get involved. In the
principle we already had, it's a

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,230
good place to put information
about the license that is used

81
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,710
apart from having a license
file, and also information about

82
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,390
the code of conduct and how to
report violations, because you

83
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,110
want people who join to know
that there is a code of conduct,

84
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,530
and that this is the Safe, safe
place to interact with others.

85
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,320
And what else communicate the
expectations around the

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,730
readiness? It is important, not
every project is ready from the

87
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,960
start. But you want to make sure
that you communicated clearly

88
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,400
what is the status of the
project? And is it very early

89
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,200
stage? Or is it ready for use?
and communicate expectations for

90
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,290
managing contributions? Like
what kind of contributions are

91
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,990
looking for? And are you like,
what is the level of your time

92
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,720
commitment? How much can you
support the contributors to your

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,690
project, because maybe you don't
have the resources and you can't

94
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,270
spend all you have limited
resources, or you have like

95
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,630
specific ways that you would
like to collaborate with others.

96
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,830
And that also means describe
communication channels. And

97
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,580
here's the example from their
retro hack GitHub repository. So

98
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,840
this is the hackathon, which is
focused on trying to represent

99
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,780
research papers. And you see
here, first of all, there is

100
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,950
this welcoming message. But also
you see the repo status, which

101
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,710
is in this case, it's Wi Fi,
which is working progress so the

102
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,310
emphasises it's it's still
working progress. But it also

103
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,060
shows you how you can join the
conversations by joining slack

104
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,930
by pressing the button join
slack join us. And you can also

105
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,630
keep in touch and see what's
happening by subscribing to the

106
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:15,840
newsletter. And you might be
already familiar with, with

107
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,210
badges. So GitHub uses those
badges on README files. These

108
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,940
are very nice way with a
colorful way of communicating

109
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,780
various things that are about
your project, there's a version

110
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,000
of your software, if you have
releases, the license, the

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,070
quality of the code, the
documentation, testing, doesn't

112
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:46,320
have a continuous integration,
things like that. And then yeah,

113
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,240
you can sprinkle it with emojis
to be more colorful. Not

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,840
everyone likes it. But if you if
you like it, that's also you can

115
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,810
make it I think it makes it a
bit more friendly. And sometimes

116
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,430
you need to communicate
something which is more

117
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,060
complicated. You want to show
how to do something, you could

118
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,840
use animated GIF for that. And
as I was mentioned, is it's very

119
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:19,230
easy to overcomplicate things in
the readme file or make it

120
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,830
difficult for others to
understand what the project is

121
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,280
about because you have an expert
dancesport you know already much

122
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,060
more about it. And and so, this
is, so how can we make it

123
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,510
easier? How can we make sure
that it's easier and accessible

124
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,880
for others? And you might have
heard about Randall Munroe is

125
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:48,600
the person who draws XKCD comics
or write sex they're both writes

126
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,340
and rich and Joe's and he wrote
this book things explainer when

127
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,820
he

128
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,780
basically like a challenge how
to describe complicated stuff in

129
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,760
the word in simple words, so he
used 10 100 most common words in

130
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,150
English language. And he
described different things like

131
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:15,210
in this case, it's abhor five,
because the rocket is not one of

132
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,340
the 10 100 most popular words,
and and then there are tools

133
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,640
that actually can help you do
it. You can use the there's the

134
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,110
link here to the upgrade or
five, you can use the editor

135
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,250
that will help you to write your
README file using only those

136
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,410
10 100 most popular words. And
and then there's the other

137
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,130
editor that will help you also
with with accessible read me

138
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,280
it's Hemingway up. Yep, I think
that's it. I don't know if

139
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,180
you're young, you're planning
the exercise in breakouts with

140
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,080
the readme files, so that's
adequate. Okay. Yeah. So that's,

141
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,000
that's it for me. And please put
in if there are more resources

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,450
So if you want to look up some
examples of README files that

143
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:09,030
are here, and put in the
hackathon, the ideas, your ideas

144
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,820
for good README file, if you
know something, if I didn't

145
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,940
mention, it's a lot of things
that I haven't mentioned. So if

146
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,210
you have, if you've seen some
great reading files, you can put

147
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,470
examples, they're an IDS. And
that's it for me. Thank you.
