00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Unknown: My name is Natasha, I'm
currently working for higher

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,150
expiry sciences. It is a startup
that came from the University of

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,390
the Western Cape. Hi, Peter. And
and we were originally working

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,410
on HIV research. And what
happened was that it was during

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:26,250
the time that the government's
encouraged people to peyten

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,060
before publishing, so they
wanted to generate some some

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,860
revenue from the publicly funded
money going into university. So

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,970
we were in a very fortunate
position, for many reasons, we

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,370
were a very tight knit group
working together. And it wasn't

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,270
the right time at the right
place at the right time to do

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,530
HIV research. Similar to people
doing viral research at the

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,820
moment during this year. So
instead of walking you through

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,800
my specific career path, because
after my PhD, I went into law

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,710
for a year and I also worked in
industry at Roche for a year

15
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,030
before going back and doing a
postdoc. And what I wanted to do

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,080
given this interesting and quite
strange idea was to look at

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,810
everything that is similar. So
the things that are universal to

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,910
to my career path. And I kind of
like thinking about it, as this

19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,170
infinity or the circle. So it
doesn't matter how much you

20
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,560
diverged, you kind of come back
to the same points again. And

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,790
I've found this very useful this
year to look back and think

22
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,730
about the things that have been
universal in life. And if I'm

23
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,740
still moving towards that goal
in the career, so it doesn't

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,750
matter what career moves, you
make it whether you still

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,610
working in towards this, this
the same direction. So for me,

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,750
these things are curiosity. So
throughout, whether it's an

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,440
academia or startup, I'm very
intrinsically driven by

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,310
curiosity. And this is often the
question and then, so what comes

29
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,920
next. So this has been
universal, whether that's

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,690
instead of startup or in
academia, the second thing is

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,770
learning and learning a slightly
different curiosity, because in

32
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,640
the startup, specifically, they
can be learning in things as

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,230
wide as company structuring in
terms of hiring new people,

34
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,580
which is somewhat similar to
academia, where you are managing

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,880
people. And so so learning for
me is specifically also during

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,560
the times when you feel like
you're not gaining knowledge,

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,270
necessarily doing the same thing
every day. If you look very

38
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,150
clearly, you are always learning
and if you define it for

39
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,020
yourself, then you will feel
that you're moving forward in

40
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,800
whatever you're doing. And then
the next thing is collaboration.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,500
And this is something that
malvika touched on. And it's

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,850
something that's that that I
really enjoy, and whether that's

43
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,120
an academia trying to work with
different research groups, or

44
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,820
within the startups
specifically, where we're such a

45
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,300
close knit team, and we work
together on a daily basis, and

46
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,050
we want to share our work and
build a successful company. So

47
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,810
collaboration is a really strong
one. And these are the things

48
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,740
that are similar to between
academia, and and and startups.

49
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,640
And then the last one is a
positive impact. And with a

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,200
positive impact, and this can be
from teaching. So when you see

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,600
students have it that that aha
moments,

52
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,160
up to users of software of your
software, where they can now

53
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,350
produce a result for a drug
resistance results for patients

54
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,540
that they couldn't do before. So
So and also. So these things are

55
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,270
the things that I've found that
are very similar between

56
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:58,260
academia and the startup, and
where people often try and find

57
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,800
the differences and try and say
that one is better than the

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,550
other. Like I've preferred
looking back and going and

59
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,550
looking at the things that are
universal for me and, and

60
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,210
defining data paths that I've
been following. And I hope that

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,080
I can keep doing that moving
forward. And I it's always

62
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,940
interesting to to provide career
guidance when I still feel like

63
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,940
I'm on a journey myself. But
based on that, and this image is

64
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,260
a little bit more issue like so
even though I've spoken about

65
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,980
the spiral and that you keep
getting back to the same kind of

66
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,840
universal theme. It's also
you're allowed to acknowledge

67
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,270
that you can change themes and
you can jump between these

68
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:48,240
staircases from time to time.
And, and for me, I have recently

69
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,960
moved to with with the COVID
pandemic, our company has gone

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,120
completely distributed and
therefore I have moved to

71
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,170
Amsterdam. So things have
changed. To me quite a bit, but

72
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,160
in terms of moving to a new
country, those themes remain the

73
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,350
same the curiosity, the learning
about new cultures, and, you

74
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,380
know, collaborating and making
new connections and then having

75
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,330
a positive impact in everything
that I do.
