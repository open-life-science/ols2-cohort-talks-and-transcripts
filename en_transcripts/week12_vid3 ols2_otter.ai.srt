00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Unknown: My name is Kimberly
Pasha, and I work as research

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,860
funder for Wellcome Trust. So,
this is not what I have always

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,890
done in my career path. And I
would like to start by giving

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,190
you a quick overview of how
Actually, I like how my career

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,450
path has unfolded, like over the
past almost 15 years. And I also

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,510
would like to share with you
perhaps top three highlights

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,240
over this path, as well as my
top three mistakes, because I

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,210
think they're also important.
And I really hope that these may

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,570
somehow inspire some ideas and
trigger questions that we can

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,580
hopefully discuss later on
during the q&a session. So I

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,940
spent my the majority of my
career in academic research and

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,290
in so called the wet lab
settings, I graduated from my

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,500
undergrad in genetics at
University of Edinburgh. And at

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,510
that point in my life, I was
very much into sales, and, and,

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,700
you know, genetics and basically
model organisms, so everything

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,720
had to matter at a microscopic
level. So, with all this love

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,870
for genetics and cells, I ended
up by getting a PhD in cellular

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,930
biology, and more specifically,
I worked on insulin signaling

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,610
pathway in fruit fly Drosophila.
And then pretty much right after

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,240
I graduated from my PhD, I
started a postdoc at University

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,810
College London. And I still
wanted to get my beloved model

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,190
organism, Drosophila and my
signaling pathway. But I started

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,190
getting more interested in the
effects as an organism level and

24
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,510
overpopulation. So my postdoc
research focused on the effects

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,720
of insulin on aging, and
lifespan control and Drosophila.

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,040
And I guess my focus somehow
upgraded from the macro level to

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,700
a macro level, because I was
done looking at longevity in

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,300
populations. But I remember that
at some point, throughout my

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,260
postdoc, I realized that if I
was sustained academia, then

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,590
that one specific question was
probably going to be what I was

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,290
going to build the rest of my
career upon, and it would be

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,370
very difficult to pivot
significantly down the line. And

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,680
somehow that really didn't sit
well with me. And with my

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,860
personality, I really missed
having a broad overview of a

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,370
research landscape and having
the flexibility to change

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,520
interests significantly.
Whenever I, you know, I felt

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,510
that it was needed. And since I
was also working at the very

38
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,230
much discovery end of things,
the impact of the outputs was

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,400
very hard to observe, which also
kind of demotivate demotivated

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,630
me. So then I thought about what
I needed to change. So I wanted

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,740
to have a job which allowed me
to have a broader view over

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,100
biomedical research, shorter
timeline to impact and also

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,540
something with the people factor
that enabled me to network and,

44
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,940
and engage and, and basically,
with people. So I apply for a

45
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,600
job as Portfolio Manager at
welcome, which I was then

46
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,650
offered. And I changed my career
probably after 10 years in

47
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,470
academic research. And actually,
I also very much recently

48
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,280
changed my job from Portfolio
Manager. And I started working

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,530
as a data challenges manager
with in the same team as yo. So

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,430
somehow, even within the
research funding landscape, my

51
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,770
job very much recently changed.
So as part of my current job, I

52
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,010
will keep an strategic overview
of the Global Health Research

53
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,550
landscape. And with main, my
main focus being the health

54
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,580
data, I look out for
opportunities to advance

55
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,020
welcomes mission as a funder.
And also I create networks, I

56
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,470
engaged with the research
community and other research

57
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,850
funding stakeholders, I build
partnerships, I enable platforms

58
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,240
to improve health globally. And
overall, I have to say it is

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,770
actually quite exciting. And so
then I guess that Oh, okay,

60
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,720
maybe like one thing I have to
add at that point is, and the

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,090
kind of somehow the power
dynamics, I was involved and

62
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,390
changed quite a lot as well,
ever since I shifted from being

63
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,630
a researcher and I started
working for a funder. In a way I

64
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,770
was at this end of the spectrum,
where I was constantly asking

65
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,060
for money to fund my research.
And now I, I became part of this

66
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,170
organization, where this kind of
decisions are made. And if I'm

67
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,320
fully honest, I do actually
really enjoy this change in

68
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,010
dynamics

69
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,280
is a is an easier place to be,
you know, in all honesty, and

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,270
Okay, so then when I thought
about three highlights from the

71
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,600
past 15 years, I think it is
really important to acknowledge

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,660
this intellectual freedom and
space for curiosity that

73
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,080
academic research has enabled me
I think, I think that's, that's

74
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,110
really that's a that's a
phenomenal opportunity, I have

75
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,280
to say, and, and similarly, this
kind of analytical skills that

76
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,000
one acquires while doing
research are so transferable and

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,600
I think at that time, I was
totally undressed. demanding it.

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
But the day that you end up at a
kind of a normal business

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,530
meeting with people, and you can
use your skills and backup where

80
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,100
arguments in a similar way that
you would back up your

81
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,090
scientific hypothesis with data,
you realize that it's actually

82
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,340
very transferable. And it's
actually quite cool to see that.

83
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,600
And I think the highlight of
being research funder is this

84
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,190
ability to influence the wider
landscape. And that also happens

85
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,290
even at a quite junior level,
you don't have to be the

86
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,920
director of something. And, and
it is nice to see this, this

87
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,070
short timeline to impact about
something that you really care

88
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,290
about. And three things I wish I
had done differently. I really

89
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,100
wish I had had a less linear
career path in academic research

90
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,360
in the way I went from 1pm. Like
from finishing the PhD right

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,270
into a postdoc, like, you know,
it seemed like everything had to

92
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,870
happen pretty quickly. And I
think that was a mistake, I

93
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,780
think I should have really had a
much more awkward facing

94
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,590
approach to things. And and the
second thing is, I think it is

95
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,180
okay to be picky. Like, if
someone offers you interesting

96
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,240
job in a good lab, it doesn't
mean that you have to take it

97
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,110
you need to think about it in
the wider context of career

98
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,630
progression, because it is
important. And also, finally,

99
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,150
when I was an academic
researcher, I really wish I had

100
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,880
done more investments into
secondary skills and I had

101
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,760
thought a little bit broader
than just you know, getting my

102
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,980
research done getting my papers
published. I think it will

103
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,990
definitely help me. Okay, so I
am going to stop here and thank

104
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,890
you for listening
