1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,459
Unknown: My background is in
biology actually. So that I

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,399
won't go into these details,
I'll just jump right in and

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,029
mention this kind of publication
that was back in 2016, about a

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:13,169
fair guiding principle for the
management of scientific data.

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,149
And as Amy was mentioning, this,
this a set of this is an acronym

6
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,709
basically, that outlines the
kind of key things that you need

7
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:26,189
to think about when you try to
release the data, or at least

8
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,649
handle the data that you're
producing in your daily, daily

9
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:31,709
life. And this has been endorsed
by a number of people, you can

10
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:36,359
see the lifestyle authors,
scanning, people doing research,

11
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,739
scientific, publishing, funding
agencies and policy really, it

12
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,209
was a cross section of all the
players. And and because they

13
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:48,629
wanted to raise this kind of
alarm, call call alarm, but in a

14
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,739
way for for improving the way
things were done and why does it

15
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,749
matter. So, basically, the main,
the main purpose is to make sure

16
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,869
that the data can be used by
machines, because or into the

17
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:03,869
production of data at such a
scale. Now, we need to be able

18
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,309
to find data, which means that
the data set can be uniquely

19
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:11,519
identified, they can be given a
unique resolvable and stable

20
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,089
identifier. This allows people
to retrieve and collect data.

21
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,089
And then what is really
important in terms of

22
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:22,379
discoverability is that you need
to describe the data with enough

23
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,649
descriptors, the metadata,
basically, and these sets of

24
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:28,499
descriptors need to be agreed by
your community, because we will

25
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:31,859
be different, we have got domain
of expertise. And in order to

26
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,159
make things understood by the
community, we need to agree on

27
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,349
the kind of common language, we
also need to think about how to

28
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,069
access the data. This means that
so far doesn't mean necessarily

29
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,779
that everything is open and
pretty available. It just tells

30
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:51,719
you that you should provide
information, and how what are

31
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,199
the conditions of access, if you
don't want to access you have to

32
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,169
tell it to tell people that
Okay, there is an embargo, for

33
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:02,429
instance, then you need to reuse
terminologies, ideally, and

34
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:06,689
again, we go back to this in a
moment, just simply to make sure

35
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,019
that there is no ambiguity. But
when you data about what you

36
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,259
actually meant with it, we need
to provide detailed provenance

37
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,859
information so that again, this
allows people to understand what

38
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:21,509
has been done, and how did it I
was generated. And all you need

39
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:25,229
to allow people to be clear,
completely clear about what are

40
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,829
the conditional reuse. This is
where the licensing issue come

41
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,339
into play. And this allows you
to make sure that your data set

42
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,429
is reusable. Or at least you
describe what under which

43
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:41,399
condition is that a sets are
allowed for for consumption. So

44
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:45,029
in a way, this comes into a
backdrop of information between

45
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:48,119
the gap between data generation
and drivability, just want to

46
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:53,729
tell you about the same AI
programs as European initiatives

47
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:59,669
that brings pharma, industry and
academic to produce to scan and

48
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,369
produce research data on a
variety of projects, massive,

49
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:07,199
it's been running since 2008,
I'd say the investment is huge,

50
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,999
you can see the number of
publications. But again, you

51
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,399
have to, to think about this
publication of scientific data,

52
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,119
typically, in principle back in
2016. That was in a way

53
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,019
complaint while calling for data
to be fair. And in 2013, there

54
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,189
was a publication again, by the
EU trying to scan I understand

55
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:31,019
what is the cost of not having
data in a fair shake. So that it

56
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,449
gives you the links to these
documents. But the take home

57
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,929
message is that in the red, in
the spy here in the red patch is

58
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:43,229
the cost of in a waste on the
expenditure of the data, not

59
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:47,009
being managed, but on the other
side is the missed opportunity.

60
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,559
Like it's almost it's, it's as
if it's like 150% of that profit

61
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:57,659
figure. It represents the missed
opportunities of not making the

62
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,619
data available, I mean, the lack
of meaning and things. And so

63
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:04,139
this is the impact on
innovation, you can have the

64
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,599
absence of data, this kind of
dark matter, we know that data

65
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,779
is around, but we can see it.
And this is why the AMA decided

66
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:12,809
to to fund a project which was
called surplus to see to

67
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:17,669
understand will improve the
processes of releasing data. So

68
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,379
I'm trying to go for an analogy
of, of cooking in a way and I

69
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,719
call it the empty fridge
problem. Let's take the

70
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:28,199
political situation where your
country is about to go in

71
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,739
lockdown. And and you want to
cook something but your fridge

72
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:35,909
looks like this. And of course
you want to go to shops, but the

73
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,329
shops basically you can't find
them because there is no way to

74
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,499
know where the shops are. And if
you happen to find a store you

75
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,499
when you look at the supplies,
they look like this. And of

76
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:49,499
course then it's a big mess if
you want to reuse anything to

77
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,289
prepare the toy your favorite
meal because you have no idea of

78
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:53,129
what is the

79
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,780
so

80
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,250
so really the notion
verification is to, is to be put

81
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,220
labels on all these scans that
we find and make them really

82
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,250
meaningful. So that basically
applying a set of metadata is

83
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,200
already interesting, you can
have information about what is

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,260
the content of the scan. And
maybe there are things that you

85
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,540
don't like to see in the scan.
And so you don't want to do

86
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,880
about it at all. And you've got
to composition you've got volume

87
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,100
going to price, you're gonna
sell number, these kind of

88
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,140
things that allow you to make a
decision whether you want to use

89
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,010
or not, that particular element.
So if you're lucky enough to

90
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,520
have to have access to this
delicacy, spaghetti bolognaise

91
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,660
in the can, you're very pleased
to to have information about the

92
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,870
metadata that you can have, it
gives you a good insight into

93
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,260
whether it selfie or not at all,
and what kind of energy you get.

94
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,030
And this is in a way on the
label. But is it really what it

95
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,540
says? So sometimes it's good to
have a certification and

96
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,440
organization to control bodies
in the campus survey, that may

97
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,200
be you know, it's organic,
really, it's not contain it

98
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,360
doesn't contain some GMO
organisms, you should want to

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,440
want to eat them. So really,
it's important to trust but

100
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,130
always check. And you may know
that there was a scandal a few

101
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,270
years back, that in some of
these scans, even though they

102
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,750
claim to be beef, they were
actually it was horse meat. And

103
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,390
of course, this is this is not
right. So it's about checking,

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,510
it's about controlling, it's
about asserting that things are

105
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,840
okay. So in the context of data
science, this is really the

106
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,410
backdrop of fair competence was
making, you know, the kind of

107
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,930
confidence crisis that we
identified, I put up a number of

108
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,050
references here, just to let you
know about the problems that we

109
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,160
faced. But as machine learning
comes into play, this is an

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,070
important of data ready nice to
make sure that the data that

111
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,280
goes into these algorithms is of
good quality. So good training

112
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,610
can occur. And the data that is
published is, is can be really a

113
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,760
mine effectively by scientist.
So there are two aspects of

114
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,090
turning phone to read it, it's
really to make sure that we have

115
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,510
the tools, the infrastructures,
the services, that we train

116
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,380
people to get familiar with
those tools, but also that we

117
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,440
have the standards, you know, I
was mentioning, again, what kind

118
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,590
of metadata descriptors you can
have in the can. This is what we

119
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,370
call standards, as well. And
this is really a matter of

120
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,590
social and technical agreement,
we need to protect and agree on

121
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,010
conversion. And this is this is
hard. But I guess it's really

122
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,090
important, no longer an option,
we have to do it. So there are

123
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,150
tools and resources to help you
in in surveying the different

124
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,180
domains, you will, you may have
different backgrounds, and you

125
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,300
may operate in very different
fields. But still, there are

126
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,590
three things that you will be
dealing with four data formats,

127
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,410
that are structures,
terminologies, and guidelines

128
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,680
and identify errors. These are,
I'm just showing a few examples.

129
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,870
In the world of stellar
developing observations, such

130
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,220
DHL seven, ISO w three CCGs can
do clinical domain, for

131
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,510
instance. But also grassroots
standards, like the genomic

132
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,620
standard Consortium, Alliance
yupo psi, the triple aim is

133
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,590
fortune and began health. And in
order to help you navigate that

134
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,490
sea of standards, you can point
go to fairsharing.org, that will

135
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,910
give you an overview, relation
between standards that are based

136
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,260
in policies that will have
somehow navigate the sea of

137
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,720
standards and make sure that for
your domain, you can find the

138
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,480
relevant resources that are
meaningful for you to establish

139
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,410
a data management plan. So on of
course, I mentioned evaluation.

140
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,500
So there are tools that have
been developed, such as the fare

141
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,700
evaluator that allows you to
give it an identifier to the

142
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,480
service, and it will run a set
of questions or set of checks

143
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,660
and give you a report. This is
in development. Of course, this

144
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,960
is the early days. But this is
also to indicate that the kind

145
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,300
of framework and infrastructure
they do exist to do to do this

146
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,320
kind of fair data. So I will
finish really with two slides. I

147
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
hope I didn't overshoot too
much. But let's let's take an

148
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,470
example of treating that
presentation as a data set. So

149
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,760
the key thing is that what could
you do this, what could you use

150
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,440
as a service to just do first
step verification, you could use

151
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,120
try to use the nudo, which is
the CERN repos repository. So I

152
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,360
could just upload login to this
website, I should have an orchid

153
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,440
ID, which is a unique identifier
for me, I hope you all have an

154
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,950
orchid ID that will help in the
process. First thing I could do

155
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,310
is to stick the file of this
presentation in this middle by

156
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,970
uploading it

157
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,640
then I need to decide what kind
of set asides it is what kind of

158
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,730
whether it's a presentation or
pure data set so you can be of

159
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,260
choice. Then moving on. I can
provide some data metadata,

160
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,100
publication title, basically,
but also you can see already can

161
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
listing authors and it's
integrated with arcade already.

162
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,990
So this is why I was mentioning
it's quite cool to have an

163
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,510
arcade. It's a persistent
identity, resolvable identifier

164
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,050
for your identity and connects
with those. And you can reserve

165
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,600
a DUI which would be a unique
identifier Again, it was

166
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,900
horrible for your MC for the
metadata about your data set.

167
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,960
Moving on, you can go back to
the terminal access. So you can

168
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,510
be accessibility, you can
describe it. And again, I insist

169
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,900
It doesn't mean to be fair, that
doesn't mean they have to be

170
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,750
open, you can set an embargo.
And the tool that I'm showing

171
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,650
you allows us just to do that,
you have to select the license.

172
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,580
That's I think, important. We
because this is about reuse, and

173
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,940
to be unambiguous about that.
And finally, I wanted to show

174
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,580
you that the tool allows you to
connect your funding sources,

175
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,730
it's always good to acknowledge
the funding agencies, because

176
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,610
they can also assess what you
actually have produced. And it's

177
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,840
also give visibility to all your
work. So you can do that with

178
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,570
the UI with the user interface
that I just showed. But you can

179
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,080
also do that, programmatically.
I've done. The address to the

180
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,380
fare cookbook that we are
developing on a fare plus, which

181
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,740
allows you to we should give you
a description of how to do that

182
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,610
with a Python script, provided
you have the API keys through

183
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,510
service. And yes, this is you
can see the message that is

184
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,720
passed to the to the by the
tool, you will have information

185
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,500
about the orchid ID obviously
embedded and i think that's

186
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,110
that's what I wanted to tell you
about to federate and give you

187
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,380
an example. I hope I didn't
overshoot too much. Thank you

188
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,275
for your attention.
