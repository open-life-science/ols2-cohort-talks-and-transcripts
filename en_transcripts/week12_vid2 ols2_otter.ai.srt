1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
Unknown: I'm an experimental
psychologist by training. I've

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,050
been at the University of
Manchester for 17 years now. And

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,710
this was actually after I spent
both three years working in

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,370
industry and doing a couple of
postdocs. So I've kind of, you

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,210
know, shifted around a little
bit over the last few years. And

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,440
I think talking about academia
today, and this, you know, brief

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,170
overview of my view of academia
today is pretty quite different

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,890
from what my view would have
been just just, you know, three

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,640
or four years or so ago. I'm
currently Senior Lecturer in the

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,270
Division of neuroscience, and
experimental psychology. And I

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,690
guess, within the UK, there's
always been a sort of difference

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,400
between universities in terms of
their focus on teaching, and

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,790
research. And I've noticed over
the last few years, actually,

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,750
there's a secular shift in terms
of University's engagement with

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,680
open research practices. At one
end of the spectrum, you've got

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,910
universities such as EU tract
and UCL are very few others are

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,510
very much leading the way in
terms of open research and

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,220
adopting open research position
statements. Or on the other end

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,910
of the extreme, you've got many
universities, who, you know,

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,180
think that open research means
no more than open access

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,240
publications. And so it's
interesting seeing universities

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,990
at different stages of this
journey. And that's one of the

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,230
biggest distinctions that I see
between universities at the

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,950
moment. And one thing I should
say, if you're interested in

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,910
staying within academia, if you
end up in a more research

26
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,780
focused university that hasn't
yet engaged with open research,

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,500
or hasn't yet adopted an open
research position statement,

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,320
it's actually a great
opportunity to shape it. And you

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,530
can put your open leadership
skills you've developed on this

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,680
course and practice, you can
kind of educate others about

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,270
what openness means to you, and
have that broader discourse. And

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,210
one of the challenges I think,
is also having conversations

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,110
with people in very different
disciplines. And a couple weeks

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,350
time, I'm giving a talk to
colleagues that will include

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,980
people with backgrounds in
Humanities Research. So again,

36
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,790
it's just understanding kind of
the language that they use, that

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,070
actually describes the same
things that you're interested

38
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,110
in. But just their differences
in terminology. If you end up in

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,390
a more teaching focused
institution, it's a great

40
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,950
opportunity as well, to teach
open and reproducible skills to

41
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,910
students. within the UK. It's
interesting to many

42
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,810
undergraduates are now starting
University, having actually had

43
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,270
practice coding in Python and
scratch at school, my daughter

44
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,400
learned how to code in Scratch
when she was about six or seven

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,530
years old. So, you know, these
foundational skills in students

46
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,090
are now coming into university
with I guess, within the context

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,800
of my own experiences, the
different talk that I would have

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,470
given four or five years ago, I
would probably reflect that my

49
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,210
disillusionment with academia,
as much as anything else, you

50
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,150
know, as I'm sure people can
attest to, academia was

51
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,410
certainly was and still is
highly competitive. Some

52
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,860
universities really focused on
big grants, and papers on high

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,820
impact journals, rather than
doing robust and reproducible

54
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,690
science. So out of out of my
disillusionment that kind of

55
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,830
encouraged me to engage with the
broader open research and

56
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,120
reproducibility conversations
that were going on on twitter at

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,960
the time, you know, two or three
years ago, and coincidentally,

58
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,540
that Coons that occurred when
the UK reproducibility network

59
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,960
was following that. So the UK
reproducibility network funded

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,220
by Marcus modaf, who at Bristol
University is focused on

61
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,080
encouraging universities within
the UK to do more reproducible

62
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,760
research, adopt more open
practices. And as a function of

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,410
the UK RM developing along with
colleagues at Manchester on

64
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,710
ritual as one of them actually,
we find that the open research

65
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,450
Working Group, which is a
grassroots Working Group, within

66
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,330
academia at Manchester, the
cross disciplines, we've got,

67
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,060
you know, I'm a psychologist,
computer scientists, we've got

68
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,870
biologists, we've got
biostatisticians. We've got

69
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,600
people in the social sciences as
well.

70
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,960
I think that's one of the really
important things to do. It's

71
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,200
actually to build a community
that crosses those traditional

72
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,400
academic disciplines. And one
thing that's very useful about

73
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,820
the open research writing group
activity that we're all engaged

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,240
in is it really raises the
profile of open research and

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,140
reproducibility within the
university. The university knew

76
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,470
that they needed to do more to
promote open and reproducible

77
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,280
research practices, but they
didn't know how to do it. So the

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,640
VP for research at Manchester
has been hugely supportive of

79
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,950
what we've been doing because in
a sense, we're doing the hard

80
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,280
work. We're actually getting The
community started, we're getting

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,060
the conversations going. So I
set on the university level,

82
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,350
open research Strategy Group.
Because up until even when I

83
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,190
joined, the group have mainly
focused on open access side of

84
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,550
things because they weren't
really sure what open research

85
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,630
was apart from that. So think
finding your community is really

86
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,840
important or creating a new
community, within your academic

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,460
environment, it's important as
well. One thing that's critical,

88
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,430
no matter what career stage
you're at, is try to find some

89
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,300
senior academics in your home
institution who will effectively

90
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,380
be vocal supporters for you and
introduce you to people, I had a

91
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,460
lot of luck at Manchester.
Because I discovered the SSI the

92
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,380
software Sustainability
Institute has been

93
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,820
transformative for both my
career and my mental well being,

94
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,020
I have to say, so meeting people
in the context of the SSI has

95
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,770
been fantastic. And having you
know, somebody like Carl,

96
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,580
Google, or somebody to go and
talk to, and ask for advice is

97
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,030
just fantastic as well, because
Carl is just a hugely important

98
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,920
than financial and wonderful
mentor to have. And just as

99
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,670
these more senior academics will
amplify your voice, it's always

100
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,300
important to remember that you
can amplify the voice of others

101
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,910
in your community. And you
should do that, because there

102
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,940
are always voices that we can,
we can amplify because of our

103
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,370
positions that we're in. So just
to finish off early wants you to

104
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,100
kind of recognize the fact that
you've all got a very unique

105
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,520
skill set. You've got
discipline, specific knowledge,

106
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,340
as well as knowledge about the
kind of computational tools

107
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,370
needed for openness, and
reproducibility. And actually,

108
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,610
not many people have the skills
and certainly not many senior

109
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,120
academics have the skills
either. So in academia, showing

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,940
that you're somebody who can
actually solve problems in new

111
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,240
ways, and are those solutions
aligned with young girls and

112
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,990
five years is really powerful
ability to demonstrate. And you

113
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,240
could end up being you know,
almost the go to collaborator

114
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,630
for other academics, wanting to
adopt up and reproducible

115
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,930
practices. So my final three
points I'm just gonna, I'm just

116
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,730
gonna make this probably applies
outside academia as well. Be

117
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,470
aware of institutional politics,
but try not to get involved, if

118
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,070
you can help it. And the other
thing I really say it's at the

119
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,370
end of the day, it's just the
job and make sure that you've

120
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,070
got life and interests outside
of your work.
