1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
Unknown: I'm here to talk to you
a about creating a positive

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,250
culture for contribution and
collaboration for your open

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,910
projects. And we will
specifically be looking at

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,510
making a contributing guide and
a code of conduct. So let's get

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,590
going. And we'll try this
quickly. So I am Lily, and I'm a

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,350
product manager for the
frictionless data project, which

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,130
is an open source project. And I
work at the Open Knowledge

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,280
Foundation. And you can also
follow me on Twitter. So what is

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,230
a project culture, the culture
is very important to think about

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,150
when you're working on an open
project, because it isn't just

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,020
you that's working on this.
Ideally, you want to be creating

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,620
a community. And we've just
heard a little bit about this,

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,130
like why you would be creating a
readme document. Part of that is

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,600
to help build up your community.
And a healthy project culture

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:06,060
has a healthy community, meaning
it has diverse members that you

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,030
know, have different backgrounds
and ideas and talents that can

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,440
help build your community. So to
help build and guide your

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,520
culture, there's a few things
you need to keep in mind. One is

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,450
that it's a conscious decision
that you as a leader need to

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,490
make. And what I mean by that is
that a culture will build itself

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,530
within your project. Regardless
of whether or not you build it,

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,990
it's like it will still happen.
But for it to be the culture

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,340
that you want to build, you need
to make some decisions, and help

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,510
it build according to your
values. So you need to identify

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,140
what your values are. And that
includes things like how should

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:00,480
people behave that are part of
this? Okay, here is a picture

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,060
example of things to think about
for your project culture. So

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,770
this is an XKCD. We're also just
talking about, can I load it up

29
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,250
on your laptop sugar, oh, just
hit both Shift keys to change

30
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,030
over to Qwerty, perhaps like is
Ctrl spacebar caps lock in to

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,830
fear scroll means through time
instead of space. And that dot

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,310
with the subtitle saying, once
I've used a computer for a while

33
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,820
no one else will ever use it
again. And this is showing you

34
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,580
that the choices that you make
determine who can or can't also

35
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,900
use your project. The project
culture is more than just its

36
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,210
goals. It's also things like the
language, shared set of norms,

37
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,340
your expectations and your
people's expectations, the tools

38
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,700
that you choose to use, and
things like how decisions are

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,870
made, and the project's
identity. So how can you build

40
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,830
your projects culture? Two ways
we're going to talk about today

41
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,480
are using clear contributor
guidelines and a code of conduct

42
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,020
that importantly, is
enforceable. So what is a

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,430
community? This image was on the
slides, and I thought it was so

44
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,000
cute. And I really like it,
because it shows that you know,

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,350
a community is about different
worlds animals here, but

46
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,530
different people, different
users, and how they all interact

47
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,180
together. And maybe you know,
one part of the community is the

48
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,270
base, like the thing that's
keeping everyone warm. But there

49
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,280
are other members of the
community that also have

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
different goals. And they have
different reasons for being part

51
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,390
of the community. So it's
important to understand why

52
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,840
people are part of the community
and what they gain from it, and

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,740
what they can get. What is
contribution? attribution is a

54
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,240
vital part of teamwork. And they
contributions come in many

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,080
different forms. And we'll talk
about those a little bit here.

56
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,350
And that they can be like
writing code, writing,

57
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:16,290
documentation, editing, giving
ideas, project management,

58
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,100
there's all sorts of things that
team members can do to help the

59
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,790
team as a whole. on GitHub,
there are several ways you can

60
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,990
look at contributors and
contributors is a specific term

61
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,380
that gets abuses. And for
instance, this is from the

62
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,500
frictionless data project. They
work on one of our repositories,

63
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,600
we have 23 contributors. So on
your GitHub projects, you will

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,850
also see how many contributors
you have.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,800
So a good way that everyone, all
of your projects should have a

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,660
contributing document. And you
can do this on GitHub. It's

67
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,290
called a contributing.md. So
it's a markdown document. And

68
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,490
here's an example of one from
one of our repositories, and so

69
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,200
it has some general guidelines
and this specific document goes

70
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,810
on for a long time that it tells
you in all potential users, how

71
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,050
they can help. So it gives you
instructions for like how to

72
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,770
write the code, according to the
style guide. And it also tells

73
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,390
you things like, the language
that is most commonly used, and

74
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,820
it can give tips for beginners.
And it will tell you things

75
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,380
like, you know, this is the
software that we use. And here's

76
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,550
where you can go to find help.
So everyone should create a

77
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,210
contributing.md file. And there
are I think there's lots of

78
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,540
examples, I think, in the notes
as well for these. Okay, so why

79
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,700
and what contributing, MD tells
you the structure of

80
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,330
contributions, it provides
guidelines, and a standard

81
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,140
style. And it's also used to
improve efficiency. So people

82
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,320
don't have to ask the leader
over and over again, you know,

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,920
how can I contribute, you can
point them to this guide. And

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,230
it's a great way to involve new
people and build up your

85
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,620
community. There are different
people that you need to consider

86
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,490
when making this contributors
guide, the owners, which would

87
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,870
be you know, most of you, owners
of the organization, or project,

88
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,410
all of the contributors, which
are all members that have done

89
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,730
something to help. And then the
consumers are the users of the

90
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,570
project. And, you know,
sometimes people will fall in

91
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,330
all three of these categories.
Okay, you can also create a

92
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,100
contributors or community page
on your website, if you have a

93
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,310
project website that's different
from the GitHub. And this is a

94
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,730
nice example from the
carpentries. And I'll just leave

95
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,880
that there for you guys to look
through later. But it has a lot

96
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,500
of great detail. Alright, so now
we're going to talk about code

97
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,130
of contracts. And why it's
important to have a code of

98
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,960
conduct. And we talked about
this a little bit already, but

99
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,280
your project or route will
really flourish with a diverse

100
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:23,700
community. But I skipped on,
hold on, you know, I think I'm

101
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,990
just going in the opposite
direction. Okay, but what if

102
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,980
something happens, if something
happens, you need to have a code

103
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,150
of conduct. A Code of Conduct is
a set of rules that outline the

104
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,270
social norms, rules and
responsibilities of an

105
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,470
individual project, party or
organization. And it's commonly

106
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,990
abbreviated as a CRC. So a lot
of people ask me, do you really

107
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,290
need a CRC? Yes, is the short
answer. But why a code of

108
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,740
conduct invites people to your
project, it sets clear

109
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,550
expectations for your community
members. And it tells

110
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,550
contributors that you care about
your community, and that you

111
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,340
care about creating a welcoming
space for everyone. Here's some

112
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,860
links to some examples of code
of conduct. And I especially

113
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,670
like the Python code of conduct,
it is the most thorough code of

114
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,650
conduct that I think I've ever
seen. And I reference it all of

115
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:31,140
the time. So I really recommend
the Python code of here's an

116
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,980
example from the CSB con put of
conduct which I helped write

117
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,950
this while earlier this year
when we went to a virtual

118
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,710
conference. And it has a lot of
the basic parts of the code of

119
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,990
conduct, it outlines who the
Code of Conduct is for what kind

120
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,130
of behavior is expected, what
kind of behavior is not allowed,

121
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,520
and importantly, the enforcement
and reporting that would occur

122
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,950
if there's a breach of the code
of conduct. So a code of conduct

123
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:10,290
is not just a box item. And a
lot of people will create one

124
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,320
say, oh, we're done. But you
actually aren't gun, it's really

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,720
important to make sure that your
code of conduct has both

126
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,800
enforcement and reporting
included in and you need to have

127
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,260
specific ways that it's clear to
people how they can report and

128
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,880
who they are reporting to. And
many of you probably heard this,

129
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,150
I think yo was mentioning the
Code of Conduct earlier, and

130
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,650
went through a lot of details.
So, you know, no one likes a

131
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,570
code of conduct is also a great
example.

132
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,680
Okay, so getting started, how do
you start with your code of

133
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,730
conduct, you should brainstorm
some core words that represent

134
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,060
your community values. And then
think about behaviors that you

135
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,870
want to encourage or discourage.
Think through the process for

136
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,320
incidents and complaints. And
then also think about the

137
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,470
consequences for people that
actually Outside of these norms

138
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,860
that are defined, and of course,
you have to understand and

139
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,000
accept your role as a project
lead. And if you are

140
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,460
uncomfortable or unsure about
how to deal with reports, reach

141
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,140
out to your community and ask
for help and support. So tips

142
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,430
and takeaways, encourage and
reward good practice, designate

143
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,430
the code of conduct and safety
committee to help you with this.

144
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,480
Make sure your code of conduct
is posted visible and clear and

145
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,050
communicated to your
contributors and use an existing

146
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,720
code of conduct. Many of them
are openly licensed, which you

147
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,670
just learned about and you can
reuse them.
