00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
Unknown: First of all, thank you
open lifecyle for inviting me to

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,990
share what we do I consider our
work is super complimentary. And

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,410
I'm really impressed with the
results of the program about

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,820
myself. I'm Julio diancie. I'm
from monocytes Cantina. I'm

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,600
currently living in Switzerland.
I'm finishing my PhD and open

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,420
science hardware and its
contribution to democratizing

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,870
knowledge production in the
global south. And as most people

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,370
in open science, I have many
hats. So I'm also co organizing

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,290
the Latin American community of
open science hardware. And I

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,320
have co founded with Alex
kucera, and an underlying asset

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,920
program that is a sibling of
open lifesite. It's called Open

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,480
hardware makers, where we give
support to new open hardware

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,240
projects. So but what is open
science hardware? What is it all

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,850
about? Okay, so it basically
boils down to this month, people

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,780
who want to make sales, need
tools to make science. And

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,520
nowadays, those tools are what
we call a black box. And they

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,200
are a bad box, because we just
input samples for information or

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,310
some kind of input, and we get
an output out of them. But we're

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,680
not 100% sure of the processes
that produce this outputs. Of

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,350
course, we know about the
principles, but we cannot

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,660
inspect tools. And the fact that
we cannot do so brings many

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,820
problems to researchers in
general. First of all, this, as

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,040
we don't know how they work,
these tools are really difficult

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,910
to modify and customize. And I
don't know if you aren't aware,

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,360
but scientists are having
studies to be one of the groups

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,140
that customize their tools the
most, which makes sense, right,

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,610
because you're always trying to
pursue new questions and to see

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,180
a bit more, so you need your
tools to be able to change with

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,250
your ideas. Second, being
proprietary, these are hard to

30
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,600
maintain. So we have personal
example, unfortunately, with a

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,760
corporate crisis in the US where
some hospitals, they don't want

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,140
to repair ventilators afraid of
breaking pain and loss. Another

33
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,730
example Another problem with
this is that science tools are

34
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,910
usually produced by a small
number of companies, and this

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,030
are therefore able to sell in
general, very expensive prices.

36
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,750
So many universities around the
world cannot access to

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,860
equipment. So as you can see,
these are consequences that

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,670
consequences that are faced by
almost everyone in academia. But

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,150
the impact is certainly bigger
in those countries that have low

40
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,760
investment in science and
technology on one side, because

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,170
science tools are more expensive
in the global south. But also

42
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,040
when science equipment breaks
down. Let's say in the UK, it's

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,460
a very different experience as
what it does in Ecuador come in

44
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,960
owner container. So why because
you depend on the supplier who

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,290
charges you a lot for sending a
specialist professionals or

46
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,320
replacement parts. This
generates huge delays in the

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,230
case that it's possible. And you
also have the restriction of

48
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,970
imports and exports, which makes
it very difficult to access. So

49
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,620
all this very practical stuff
translates into questions that

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,780
are not pursued translates into
limitations for for research and

51
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,350
less powerful, he says, at the
end of the day, less diversity

52
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,390
of perspectives and science. And
the main idea, or the main

53
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,110
takeaway here is that we are
reinforcing the pattern where

54
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,410
most science is produced by
those who have already money to

55
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,880
produce it. So some people
started thinking about why not

56
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,720
opening the designs of science
stores and some changes and

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,500
access to hardware design during
the lesson years makes us think

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,710
that it's possible. So for
example, the reliability of

59
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,200
software free open source
software for designing and

60
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,860
testing hardware. The rise of 3d
printing is ideal for

61
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,370
prototyping and for low volume
distributed production. The

62
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,860
access to cheaper electronic
components and projects like

63
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,680
Arduino the democratized
electronic design, the

64
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,890
massification of the internet as
a way to share experiences and

65
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,860
learn from each other. And the
work of an amazing community

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,550
that's been doing a lot for
improving the ways in which

67
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,990
hardware design is ensured.

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,660
The good thing is that it's been
a while and the results are

69
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,760
showing. So here I'm just I will
just show three very good

70
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,180
examples of open science how to
work in action. But there are

71
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,120
many, many others inside and
outside academia. And the good

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,730
thing is that because they're
open, they can learn from each

73
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,320
other. So on the left in
Tanzania open flexure is a

74
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,560
project that has enabled short
circuit production of

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
microscopes that are being used
in education, research and

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,100
clinical diagnosis of malaria.
Open flexor is a UK project

77
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,390
originally, but they are
producing now microscopes at a

78
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,080
local makerspace and this can be
easily The source repaired

79
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,310
without dealing with inputs and
huge costs and delays. Another

80
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,700
example or your mouth is success
in conservation biology, you can

81
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,450
imagine it as a very big ear
that logs sound all around. It

82
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,750
has a very big community of
users improving and customizing

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,840
it. And it's leading to
developing new methods to

84
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,140
address research questions that
before were consider untestable.

85
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,560
Finally, here, in in bedroom,
epidemiology, researchers have

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,430
designed and built an open
source device to track malaria

87
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,120
spread in Amazonian indigenous
populations, and they were able

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,840
to do so in a way that respects
the preferences of these

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,140
populations. And that tolerates
also the very difficult

90
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:50,310
conditions weather conditions of
the Amazon. It's so it's it's

91
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,780
such a growth in open science
hardware that we also see, for

92
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,100
example, policies, national
policies, policy recommendations

93
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,360
for Finland, which are
suggesting the country to adopt

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,650
an open science hardware
strategy at a national level. So

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,600
that was these year 2020. So
just to sum up, open science

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,510
hardware is any piece of
hardware that is used for

97
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,420
scientific investigations, and
that anyone can obtain assemble

98
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,020
your study, modify, share, and
sell because you can build of

99
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,720
course hardware, but you may
also want to just buy it and

100
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,300
make sure that you can modify it
or do anything you want with it

101
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,280
later. The word hardware in some
languages may bias us towards

102
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,420
electronics. But open hardware
open science, however, refers

103
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,570
also besides standard lab
equipment, to auxiliary

104
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,440
materials, sensors, biological
research, regions, analog

105
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,760
musical, digital electronics,
and also mechanical tools. And

106
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,510
this huge circle in the middle
reminds us that the heart of

107
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,900
open science hardware is good
documentation. So user guides,

108
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,500
but also contribution
contribution guides, sharing

109
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,070
files in editable formats, many
other good practices that the

110
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,460
community has defined to ensure
that everyone has access to your

111
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,640
hardware design, with the idea
of improving projects instead of

112
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,910
constantly reinventing the
wheel. So one of the main ideas

113
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,680
here for the committee from the
community is that if we really

114
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,970
want open science to be
transformative, we cannot limit

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,390
Open Science practice to open
data and open access

116
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,320
publications. That's a minimum
threshold. But if we really want

117
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,800
to open science to other actors
inside and outside academia, we

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
need to be able to share the
tools we use to work. And this,

119
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,010
as I mentioned, has benefits in
terms of efficiency and of

120
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,400
course, reproducibility in
science, but also in opening who

121
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,040
is able to read your scientific
knowledge and whose questions

122
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,780
matter. So there you see the
logo in the bottom got community

123
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,750
is the community gathering
people pushing for Open Science

124
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,280
hardware to be ubiquitous by
2025? And it really might do to

125
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,580
check the manifesto assign it if
you agree with our values.

126
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,570
Finally, how can you get
involved? How can you

127
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,200
participate? Okay, so the entry
point I would say this, the gosh

128
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,530
forum, you see that you are out
there, you can drop a question,

129
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,200
people are super friendly, you
can search for the regional

130
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,540
communities in the forum and
connect to the people that are

131
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,970
near you. You can also use the
open no help project, which was

132
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,300
fine, the ability protocol that
was established for open

133
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,360
hardware in general, not only
for science, because you will

134
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,910
see they're open Hello projects
and in many different platforms.

135
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,270
Some of them are in GitHub, get
lab, wiki, factory,

136
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,040
Instructables, hackaday. There
are many platforms, but open

137
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,290
know how is a protocol that
unifies findability, whatever

138
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,820
platform your project is in. You
can search for keywords there.

139
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,360
You can also read or submitted
assigned to the journal open

140
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,300
Howard the cool stuff is that
your documentation will also be

141
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,120
peer reviewed, which is super
interesting. And you can follow

142
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,730
open homemakers in Twitter,
where we will announce our next

143
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,380
cohort after this year where we
run a super big community and

144
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,840
expert consultation to improve
our curriculum and program. So

145
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,550
that's all thank you so much for
listening. Those are the ways

146
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,330
you can contact me and feel free
to ask me any questions. Thank

147
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:21,690
you.

148
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:31,410
Oops. That was holy. Holy is on
the slack. So you can ask

149
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,420
questions there. We have also
left.

150
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,170
Sorry.

151
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,670
Yes, tiny glitch there. So that
was 844. Today, before we close

152
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,100
out, we want you to know that we
also have homework for today.

153
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:03,120
Let me find the pack MD Just so
you know the homework frequency

154
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,890
is reducing now, what you have
done in the past, which which

155
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,970
was about creating README file,
starting your contribution file,

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
starting your code of conduct,
and roadmapping, these are

157
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,690
something that you will continue
to advance. So it's not that the

158
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,150
week have weeks are over, you
are going to work on this. So

159
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,130
please continue working on those
aspects. In the next week,

160
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,090
please start to share your
Project Online. We have

161
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,510
demonstrated good pages, you can
also use Google site, which

162
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,120
could be similar for a lot of
people who don't want to use

163
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,290
GitHub. We also can use
WordPress free or other any

164
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,300
platform. If you want to just
strictly be on GitHub, that's

165
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,560
also fine. But please, have a
detailed README, please choose a

166
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,880
license, start working on your
code of conduct, create a

167
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,480
project development plan, we
have created a small assignment

168
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,620
that can help you use a dial
method. The that is linked in

169
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,420
the line number 466. And after
these assignment, think about

170
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,720
putting your roadmap up. But
this is something that we will

171
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,630
also talk about in next week,
mostly because we will talk

172
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,410
about science dissemination. So
our project is not just about

173
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,260
developing but sharing as well.
So this is something we want to

174
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,490
start working on in the next
week onwards. Without we're done

175
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,570
on time. That's amazing. Any
questions that you have, we can

176
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,540
take it in the last one minute
but I'll stop recording. Thank

177
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,680
you for joining today.

178
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,210
Thanks, Slavica.
