1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Unknown: All I'm going to do is
take take a little shift and

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,000
just highlight some things that
I have come across that have

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,300
been essential in my journey. So
I am supposed to be speaking on

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,980
social enterpreneurship. But
that is quite difficult to give

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,290
specific tips around how you get
there. But I hope in sharing my

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,260
journey that you'll be able to
do something still be relevant

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,990
for you. So, my journey started
out in Ghana, I lived there for

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,710
17 years, and I highlights the
things I was exposed to because

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,740
some people may not necessarily
have this background, I grew up

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,300
in a lower middle class family
Christian farming family. And

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,510
then I had the opportunity of
spending two years in Costa Rica

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,080
to a scholarship, which really
changed my life. And my

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,190
perspective, at that age, being
in on a campus with students

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,650
from over 60 different countries
is just life altering. After

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,460
that went to the US where I did
my undergrad in biology and had

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,400
my Master's in computer science.
And at that point, I was very

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,620
much interested in
bioinformatics research. And

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,790
that was the trajectory in which
I thought I was going, then life

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,840
happened, though, because of a
regulation which involved the

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,680
visa that I had, I could stay in
the US as long as I wanted. But

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,860
all the jobs that I got, I
couldn't take them because now

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,610
my employment authorization was
taken away. So it was either

23
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,060
stay in the US and just be
there, or I find something else

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,870
to do. And an opportunity opened
up for me to come back home to

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,630
Ghana. And I took that I came to
work at a tech incubator where

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,640
we're helping startups build
their companies from Nigeria,

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,380
Ghana, and Kenya. And that was
an opportunity to also become a

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,940
local Open Data advocate, a
leader because a lot of these

29
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,490
companies were not necessarily
thinking about the power of

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,810
data, and an open data became
the avenue to really leverage on

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,640
these skills. I quickly became
known as the Open Data person.

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,310
And that opened opportunities
for me to work on for the next

33
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,290
four years after that, with
first Open Knowledge Foundation,

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,700
which is based in the UK working
remotely. supporting other

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,570
organizations, journalists,
civil society, organizations,

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,870
governments really thinking
about how they can make data

37
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,030
sets open for different
purposes. The experience through

38
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,240
that has allowed me to work
across three different countries

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,760
and five continents. And the
power of that, interestingly, is

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,930
not in the technical skills,
they are relevant from computer

41
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,830
science and biology. But it has
been the understanding of people

42
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,680
the ability to connect with
people and the problems that

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
you're solving, and how to kind
of sit with them on whatever

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,240
journey they have, and then be
able to work backwards and see

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,990
what tools and skills you can
provide to them to enable them

46
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,860
to get to their destination.
Last year, I decided to leave my

47
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:15,960
job to become a farmer. Yes. And
it is because I think looking at

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,630
my career trajectory, my job.
All the jobs I've had, I've

49
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,160
always been pointing to one
thing, how do I help enable

50
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,320
people become better at what
they are good at. And I think

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,870
from working all across these
jobs, some of the things that

52
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,630
stood out to me was that in
particularly resource

53
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,630
constraints, environments, you
have very talented people

54
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,800
dealing with very difficult
challenges. And all they need to

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,570
have is for people to point out
what specific tools or processes

56
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,940
they can have access to, for
them to get along their journey.

57
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,380
And for me, growing up in a
family farming family, I saw an

58
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,340
opportunity to help smallholder
farmers really leverage on some

59
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,610
of the skills that I have to
really make their lives much

60
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,210
better. So that is what I'm
currently working on. And also

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,680
10% of my time is helping other
startups really figure out how

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,160
they can leverage on data to
solve problems. So one of the

63
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,090
startups is trying to figure out
how to develop simple tools to

64
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,190
make migrants where kids have
better financial literacy. And

65
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,770
another one is building
educational platforms that can

66
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,370
educate African children. Just
quickly, what is going gold

67
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,670
farms working on we are working
on 14 solving problems, you want

68
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,040
to figure out ways to
consistently produce healthy and

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,680
affordable food using
sustainable and accessible

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,730
practices.

71
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,980
Then we want to build capacity
of other farms and farmers to do

72
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,160
so sustainability. So transfer
these skills on a broader

73
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,120
distributor level. And then
another challenge that a lot of

74
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,630
smallholder farmers have is that
they usually produce either one

75
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,860
crop depending on on Whether so
can we think of ways to

76
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,230
diversify that, but also move
their raw materials to process

77
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,370
forms. And then finally, make
farms spaces of attraction,

78
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,210
innovation, recreation and fun.
They are very technical problems

79
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,730
that we need to solve all of us
this, which will leverage on

80
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,300
computation economics,
anthropology. And I think that's

81
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,900
what makes it exciting as a
social intrapreneur. If I can

82
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,240
call myself that now. On a
typical day, I am reading about

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,570
and implementing research to
these problems that are listed

84
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,310
out. So reading papers around
geolocation, and how can you

85
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,220
figure out that constraint of
soil in order to determine what

86
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,770
crops can grow around that
without having access to

87
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,110
internet. So these are very
interesting problems to be

88
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,250
really thinking through. I think
the most powerful thing putting

89
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,060
together an enable the team of
people, you can solve this

90
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,170
alone. So how do you sell that
vision to people and allow that

91
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,590
team to have the capacity to
really solve the problem with

92
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,880
and then believing in ourselves,
it's, you get two points where

93
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,280
nobody else believes me by
believing yourself as a team,

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,190
they keep on working at it, and
you get encouraged and you keep

95
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,740
on going. Because at the core,
you believe that you're solving

96
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,190
something, at least for solving
and other people. I'm just gonna

97
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,030
quickly go through some what I
call carrier anecdotes, these

98
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,290
are just my own reasons. be
versatile, that's one thing I've

99
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,460
learned. One of the things that
have been important for me is to

100
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,320
initially generalize, be able to
have some understanding of a

101
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,800
broad set of different things.
So if you're a research person

102
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,500
still understand how to
communicate with people still

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,890
understand how to facilitate how
to even do comedy, if you want

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,480
justice, be versatile, at the
same time to have one thing that

105
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,570
you are known for, for me, is
the ability to take complex

106
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,770
things and simplified for other
people to have and to be able to

107
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:06,510
use. See people and lets people
see, and what do I mean by that?

108
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,000
It is so easy to get bogged down
and technical things and

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,470
research and Miss people or
focus on the job, those are all

110
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,340
relevant. But I think when you
see people in all the jobs I've

111
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,590
done, I've had at least one
person that I still stay in

112
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,220
touch with, who knew me for more
than what I was able to do as

113
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,270
part of my role. So they could
either come talk to me, bounce

114
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,260
ideas off me knew about my
passions outside of work. And

115
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,140
even if you find employers that
will be clear about that, that

116
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,900
is actually much more powerful.
And also let people see you,

117
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,360
especially people who are from
backgrounds that are not

118
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,660
necessarily predominance in
whatever space that you're

119
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,860
working in. Make sure that you
create opportunities for

120
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,060
yourself to be seen speak. And I
know sometimes it can be

121
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,420
difficult, but speak,
participate in events, try as

122
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,330
much as possible for people to
also know that you are more than

123
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,570
just your title. And this is
kind of like a joke, candy

124
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,620
identity, no job, no, do not do
that do not ground the identity

125
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,580
in your job, your job will go
away, it will disappear. Lets

126
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,730
your identity be much more than
that. So that when your job

127
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,430
changes, when you want to do
something else, you still have

128
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,010
that identity that will keep you
going when things fail, you

129
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,560
still have that identity now
keep going. And that's what's

130
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,650
been keeping me going. And I
think in the same sense, people

131
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,770
have seen my passions and when
even I was leaving my job last

132
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,650
year, they were encouraging me.
My team was saying go do it.

133
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,030
We'll support you in that. The
last thing I'll say brief, most

134
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,350
important thing in this life is
your life. Everything else is

135
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,910
replaceable. And with that, I'll
say stay human or humane and be

136
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,090
open to to whatever is possible
given the stuff that you have.

137
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,950
So I'll stop here.
