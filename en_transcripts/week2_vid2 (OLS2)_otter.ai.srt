1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Unknown: We are going to talk
about open canvas. And this is

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,830
another exercise that basically
helps you think through in a

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,760
structured way, what you're
going to be doing, by forcing

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,400
you to fit all of your ideas
into a tiny a4 sheet.

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,239
So,

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,969
yeah, open Canvas allows you to
think through your project

7
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,479
strategy. And there are also
some examples available. And we

8
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,999
will ask you to actually finish
this on on your own after the

9
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:29,339
call. And as I mentioned, we
will be showing this statement

10
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,979
many different times with
different sections of it bolded

11
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:34,619
each to each time as we go
through. So here we're talking

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:40,019
about designing our projects
that empower others to

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,539
collaborate with inclusive
communities, but specifically

14
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,839
the design that we're thinking
about here. And the other.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,720
Off the word slide

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,980
that will become very familiar
here is the, like I mentioned

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,980
earlier, focus on the design
within the Mozilla open

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,230
leadership framework. So we're
talking about helping people

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,170
understand, share, and
participate and feel included.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,800
But I will get on to what the
open Canvas actually is, which

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,070
is perhaps the most exciting bit
of this. So it looks something

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,090
like this, we have a link, I
think it's in the probably in

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,740
the hack MD notes, you'll be
able to see a link to that. And

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,710
what this does is it provides
you a really structured way to

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,310
think about what the products
that you're creating is and the

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,640
community that will be involved,
both contributing and consuming

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,690
it. And moving on to the next
slide, here are some examples,

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,140
we can talk through this a
little bit more. So you can work

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,170
through this in a sort of nice
little flow way to think about

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,080
the things but if you get stuck
on any given box, it's also okay

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,400
to skip one and then come back
to it later. So looking at top

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,340
left, we talk about the top
problem or problems that you

33
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,000
want to solve with a project
that you're working on. So if I

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,300
was to do this, for example, for
lls, the top problem we might

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,390
want to solve would be the lack
of openness in the scientific

36
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,470
community. Their solution for
this, you think about what the

37
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,780
solution and again, if there's
more than one problem, you might

38
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,680
want to put more than one item
in this box. For or less I guess

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,650
our answer to solving the
problem will be to create a

40
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,040
program that allows other people
to learn more about openness,

41
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,340
and also to share it with
others, then how will we measure

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,850
success? And since I'm doing
this on the fly for lls I'm

43
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,430
almost in a minor panic here,
what do I how do we how do we

44
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,760
measure our level of success,
I'll say given that we have a

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,640
much bigger cohort for round to
the round one that this looks

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,310
like some measure of success, if
we look at counting the number

47
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,480
of people who are participating.
And the number of mentors and

48
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,630
experts that we have on board,
if we keep on seeing that climb,

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,590
or at least remain the same
rather than shrink, and I think

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,040
we are doing really well. For
your projects, this will

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,590
obviously be something else.
resources required. So this

52
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,520
might be that you need people's
time, it might be that you need

53
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,450
technical support, it might be
skills that you need, it might

54
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,390
be infrastructure, it might be
lab space, there are a lot of

55
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,970
different things that actually
the resources that you might be

56
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,240
looking for could be really
depends on what your project is.

57
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,630
And then moving on from here,
you start thinking, Okay, so

58
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,060
this is roughly what I want to
design. And now let's start

59
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,180
thinking about the people. And
so you can start thinking about

60
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,570
the contribution profiles. And
so this will be people who are

61
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,480
actually helping out with what
you're doing. And you want to

62
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,020
think who they are, what they
might like to do, how they might

63
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,280
like to contribute. And like we
mentioned earlier, you may want

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,740
to be thinking about the people
who have the expertise that came

65
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,890
from the resources required
section. And then you start

66
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,530
thinking about the user profile.
So these are the people who are

67
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,980
actually consuming what you're
creating these may be the same

68
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,590
people, as the contributors, or
they may be other people, it

69
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,400
really depends on what you're
designing. And then you also

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
start thinking about the
channels. So now that you know

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,990
the people that you're going to
be working with both people

72
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,890
creating the work and the people
who are consuming it, you start

73
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,680
thinking about how you will get
this new contributions and how

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
to get the new users and again,
it's okay, if these groups

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,470
overlap as well as you don't
have, they might be distinct

76
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,560
people or they might not. And
once you've thought through all

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,170
of those, maybe you have a
unique value proposition. So

78
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,670
this is perhaps reflecting back
on that vision as the the

79
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,370
statement that we've just been
working on. Maybe you want to

80
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,070
tweak it, or maybe you just want
to bring that mission and vision

81
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,690
statement right in here. And I
remember I was asked to do this,

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,720
I sort of thought okay, this
looks a bit tedious. But by the

83
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,570
time it actually worked through
what I could put in each box and

84
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,140
discussed it with my mentor, I
found it really useful, like I

85
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,780
thought really critically about
my project and the things and

86
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,870
the people that needed to bring
on board. So I would highly

87
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,660
recommend spending some time
thinking about this and going

88
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,870
through it with other people.
And if you're not sure bouncing

89
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,020
it off other people like maybe
in the iOS chat, for example is

90
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,300
a really good way to help you
think critically through the

91
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,530
best that you might be
struggling with. Okay, I think

92
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,380
it's gonna ask me on my slides
to walk through on all the stuff

93
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,600
that I've just done. But I'll
use that as a moment to have a

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,510
really quick recap. So left
side, we're talking about the

95
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,090
thing that we're creating right
side, we'll be talking about the

96
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,190
people talking about the
problems, we want to solve the

97
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,390
solution on the way that we that
you want to apply to that

98
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,910
problem, the ways to measure
their success. And then thinking

99
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,220
about the resources that you
need to get there. Once again,

100
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,740
think about the contributor
profiles, what types of

101
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,420
contributors and what sort of
personalities, people

102
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,860
backgrounds, they may have.

103
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,140
But I'm going to skip that
slide, because I'm not sure what

104
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,060
to say about that one. And then
also think about your users, and

105
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,550
the channels that you may have
to get them. Yeah, I'm just

106
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,590
gonna stop repeating this,
because I think I went through

107
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,720
it when I was just looking at
the next slide. And here, we

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,260
also have an example open canvas
here that is looking about

109
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,230
contribution ship badges for
science. So this is just working

110
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,860
through some of the demos, for
example, as well. So if you look

111
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,620
at the top, we're looking at
lack of recognition for certain

112
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,620
contribution types. And the
solution here was to give people

113
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,000
badges to gamify it. And so in
this case, the metrics that we

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,460
had was a number of publishers
using the badges and the number

115
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,940
of badges rewarded. And the
bottom left, you can see some of

116
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,250
the resources, you can say
someone said, we're going to use

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,430
some free hardware, a Heroku
process. And that's just the

118
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,490
type of server. They've taught
that they also need resources to

119
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,540
develop this to design this, and
also networking resources. So

120
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,480
publishers and orchids people
who are going to buy in to

121
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,060
actually using these batches, so
some of the different types of

122
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,560
resources you might need. Moving
over to the Community Profiles.

123
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,840
So that's on the left, we've got
contributions might be

124
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,240
developers, at publishers and at
orchids. And then also that you

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,510
have researchers who care about
the idea of these contributions

126
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,260
and maybe wants to code or want
to get the badges. moving

127
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,990
upwards, one box, you can see
the user profile, the use will

128
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,020
be publishers, researchers, and
once again, it might be awkward.

129
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,070
And then the channels for these
people, you're looking at a buy

130
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:21,150
in from an employer. So it's I
guess, if you want these badges

131
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,070
to measure, then you probably
want your employees to care

132
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,370
about the badges as well as this
is thinking critically about

133
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,670
who's going to be contributing
and how, as well as users who

134
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,150
and who may want new features.
And then you can reflect back on

135
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,450
to the user profiles as to who
those users are. And then we

136
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,110
have some user channels. And
this is looking mostly at social

137
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,590
media, and it talks at ways to
get these people. And then

138
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,920
finally moving all the way back
up to the top the top right

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,650
square, we have a unique value
profit proposition after having

140
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,220
thought through this. So the
unique value is issuing badges

141
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,610
to credit office. And that the
author roles may also be on your

142
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,400
papers. And so these are the
reasons that people might want

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
to buy into this. So I hope
hopefully that sort of

144
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,590
elucidates how the open Canvas
can help you think through a

145
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,780
given problem. And if you wish
to run your own open Canvas,

146
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,980
there's also a short link here
bitch dot L y flash or LS dash

147
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,370
open dash Canvas, but I think
there's probably a link in the

148
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,600
handy notes as well.
